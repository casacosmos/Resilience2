CHAPTER TWO: INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE 

 

2.1  INTRODUCTION TO INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE 

Resilience is the capacity to maintain competent functioning in the face of major life 
stressors.  (Kaplan, Turner, Norman, & Stillson, 1996, p. 158) 

George  Vaillant  (1993)  defines  resilience  as  the  “self-righting  tendencies”  of  the 
person, “both the capacity to be bent without breaking and the capacity, once bent, 
to spring back” (p. 248).  (Goldstein, 1997, p. 30) 

Resilience  means  the  skills,  abilities,  knowledge,  and  insight  that  accumulate  over 
time as people struggle to surmount adversity and meet challenges.  It is an ongoing 
and  developing  fund  of  energy  and  skill  that  can  be  used  in  current  struggles.  
(Garmezy, 1994 in Saleebey, 1996, p. 298)  

[Resilience  is]  the  capacity  for  successful  adaptation,  positive  functioning  or 
competence  …  despite  high-risk  status,  chronic  stress,  or  following  prolonged  or 
severe trauma.  (Egeland, Carlson, & Sroufe, 1993, in Sonn & Fisher, 1998, p. 458) 

Resilience is primarily defined in terms of the “presence of protective factors (personal, 

social, familial, and institutional safety nets)” which enable individuals to resist life stress 

(Kaplan  et  al.,  1996,  p.  158).    An  important  component  of  resilience,  however,  is  the 

hazardous,  adverse  and  threatening  life  circumstances  that  result  in  individual 

vulnerability (ibid.).  An individual’s resilience at any moment is calculated by the ratio 

between  the  presence  of  protective 

factors  and  the  presence  of  hazardous 

circumstances. 

literature: 

Polk  (1997)  has  synthesised  four  patterns  of  resilience  from  the  individual  resilience 

(cid:153) Dispositional Pattern.  The dispositional pattern relates to physical and ego-related 

psychosocial  attributes  that  promote  resilience.    These  entail  those  aspects  of  an 

individual that promote a resilient disposition towards life stressors, and can include 

a  sense  of  autonomy  or  self-reliance,  a  sense  of  basic  self-worth,  good  physical 

health and good physical appearance. 

(cid:153) Relational Pattern.  The relational pattern concerns an individual’s roles in society 

and his/her relationships with others.  These roles and relationships can range from 

close and intimate relationships to those with the broader societal system.

(cid:153) Situational  Pattern.    The  situational  pattern  addresses  those  aspects  involving  a 

linking  between  an  individual  and  a  stressful  situation.    This  can  include  an 

individual’s problem solving ability, the ability to evaluate situations and responses, 

and the capacity to take action in response to a situation. 

(cid:153) Philosophical Pattern.  The philosophical pattern refers to an individual’s worldview 

or life paradigm.  This can include various beliefs that promote resilience, such as the 

belief  that  positive  meaning  can  be  found  in  all  experiences,  the  belief  that  self-

development is important, the belief that life is purposeful. 

Barnard  (1994,  pp.  139-140)  identified  nine  individual  phenomena  that  the  literature 

repeatedly has shown to correlate with resiliency: 

(cid:153) “Being perceived as more cuddly and affectionate in infancy and beyond. 

(cid:153) “Having no sibling born within 20-24 months of one’s own birth. 

(cid:153) “A higher level of intelligence. 

(cid:153) “Capacity and skills for developing intimate relationships. 

(cid:153) “Achievement orientation in and outside of school. 

(cid:153) “The  capacity  to  construct  productive  meanings  for  events  in  their  world  that 

enhances their understanding of these events. 

(cid:153) “Being able to selectively disengage from the home and engage with those outside, 

and then to reengage. 

(cid:153) “Being internally oriented and having an internal locus of control. 

(cid:153) “The absence of serious illness during adolescence.” 

The  capacity  of  an  individual  to  cope  during  difficulty  is  central  to  their  resilience.  

Pearlin and Schooler (1982, p. 109) define coping as “the thing that people do to avoid 

being harmed by lifestrain.”  These authors conducted 2300 interviews in the urbanized 

Chicago  area  and  through  content  analysis  of  these  interviews  identified  three  main 

types of coping that serve distinct functions, viz: 

(cid:153) “Responses  that  change  the  situation  out  of  which  strainful  experience 

arises” (Pearlin & Schooler, 1982, p. 115).  Interestingly, their research found that 

this type of coping was not widely used.  Several reasons are offered to explain this.  
Page 6 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

People  must  first  recognize  the  situation  which  is  causing  the  stress;  something 

which  is  not  always  possible.    People  may  not  know  how  to  change  the  situation 

directly.    Acting  on  a  situation  to  change  it  may  result  in  even  further  stressors, 

which  in  turn  inhibits  further  action.    Some  situations  are  not  amenable  to  change 

efforts. 

(cid:153) It  is  interesting  to  note  that  much  of  resilience  theory  and  research  has  revolved 

around  situations  which  are  impervious  to  change  efforts,  such  as  being  in  a 

concentration camp, having a terminal illness, being in a war, growing up in poverty, 

etc.    In  such  circumstances,  little  can  be  done  to  directly  change  the  situation 

causing the stress.  Rather, other forms of coping are required. 

(cid:153) “Responses  that  control  the  meaning  of  the  strainful  experience  after  it 

occurs but before the emergence of stress” (Pearlin & Schooler, 1982, p. 115).  

Pearlin and Schooler found this to be the most common coping type.  This coping can 

entail  making  positive  comparisons  which  reduce  the  perceived  severity  of  the 

stressful situation, selectively ignoring parts of the situation so as to concentrate on 

some  less  stressful  aspect  of  the  situation,  and  reducing  the  relative  importance  of 

the stress situation in relation to one’s overall life situation. 

(cid:153) “Responses that function more for the control of the stress itself after it has 

emerged” (Pearlin & Schooler, 1982, p. 115).  This coping type does not attack the 

situation itself, either directly or through meaning or perception.  Rather, the focus of 

the  coping  is  on  the  resultant  stress  itself  and  entails  basic  stress  management 

responses.  “Out of the beliefs and values in the culture people are able to create a 

strategy  for  manageable  suffering,  a  strategy  that  can  convert  the  endurance  of 

unavoidable hardships into a moral virtue” (ibid., p. 117). 

An  intervention  was  conducted  in  an  occupational  setting  to  enhance  the  coping  of 

employed  mothers (Kline & Snow, 1994).  The group-based intervention was based on 

Pearlin  and  Schooler’s  “model  of  coping  and  adaptive  behavior:  attacking  the  problem, 

rethinking the problem, and managing the stress” (ibid., p. 109).  In comparison with a 

control  group,  “at  6-month  follow-up,  intervention  participants  reported  significantly 

lower  work-family  and  work  environment  stress,  higher  social  support  from  work 

sources, less avoidance coping, and lower psychological symptomatology” (ibid., p. 105). 

This intervention demonstrates the practical and clinical value of resilience theories.  By 

promoting  positive,  constructive  coping  skills,  the  investigators  were  able  to  make 

significant changes to the problems experienced by the participants, even though these

problems were not specifically addressed.  Furthermore, the intervention operationalises 

the  theory  of  coping  developed  by  Pearlin  and  Schooler  (1982),  creating  the  links 

between theory, practice and research. 

The  individual  approach  to  resilience  has tended  to  emphasise  resilience  as  an internal 

phenomenon,  an  emphasis  that  is  only  challenged  later,  and  with  difficulty,  by  family 

resilience  researchers.    Walsh  (1996,  pp.  262-263),  for  example,  states,  “Resilience  is 

commonly thought of as inborn, as if resilient persons grew themselves up: either they 

had the ‘right stuff’ all along – a biological hardiness – or they acquired it by their own 

initiative  and  good  fortune.”    Similarly,  Goldstein  (1997,  p.  32)  states,  “Jordan  gives 

greatest  weight  to  resilience  as  a  state  of  mind.    This  means  that  basic  principles  of 

helping  begin  with  a  primary  focus  on  –  or  better,  a  commitment  to  –  how  clients 

perceive  their  world.”    This  perspective  will  be  apparent  throughout  this  section  on 

individual resilience.  Indeed, a great contribution of resilience theory has been to help 

us  understand  how  an  individual’s  perspective  on  life  difficulties  fundamentally  affects 

the individual’s experience of and response to the difficulty. 

Individual  resilience  theory  began  with  studies  of  children  who  rose  above  adverse 

childhood  conditions.    This  research  highlighted  factors  and  models  to  explain  how 

children develop resilience.  Antonovsky’s salutogenic theory addressed the question of 

health  in  adults.    Various  other  models  have  been  advanced  over  the  years  to  explain 

how  people  stay  healthy  and  happy,  even  in  difficult  times.    These  themes  will  be 

addressed in the following sections. 

 

2.2  RESILIENCE IN CHILDREN 

Longitudinal studies on children who were born into adverse conditions have formed the 

foundation  of  much  of  our  current  understanding  of  resiliency  in  adults  and  families.  

These studies tracked children who, according to various indicators, were considered to 

be  children  at  risk.    Over  a  number  of  decades,  researchers  have  become  increasingly 

able to identify those features that are associated with the children who rose above their 

circumstances. 

Werner and Smith’s (1992) study in Kauai, Hawaii, which began in 1955, is probably the 

most  well  known  study  of  this  nature.    By  age  18,  one  third  of  the  participants,  who 

were  assessed  at  birth  to  be  ‘at  risk,’  had  developed  into  “competent  and  confident 

young  adults”  (Saleebey,  1996,  p.  299).    By  age  32,  two  thirds  of  the  remaining 
Page 8 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

participants “had turned into caring and efficacious adults” (ibid., p. 300).  This research 

demonstrates  firstly  that  certain  factors  protect  vulnerable  children  from  dysfunction, 

and  secondly  that  a  vulnerable  person’s  life  course  can  change  at  any  time  and  is  not 

completely determined in early childhood (ibid.). 

Cederblad and her colleagues (Cederblad, Dahlin, Hagnell, & Hansson, 1994) conducted 

a  similar  study  in  Sweden,  starting  in  1947.    Children  who  were  exposed  to  three  or 

more  factors  that  are  associated  with  later  mental  illness  were  included  in  the  study 

(Dahlin,  Cederblad,  Antonovsky,  &  Hagnell,  1990,  p.  229).    A  follow-up  of  these 

participants  in  1988,  when  they  were  in  their  40’s  and  50’s  indicated  that “almost  half 

the  sample  succeeded  in  creating  a  reasonably  successful  and  at  least  moderately 

healthy life despite the severe handicaps in their childhoods! … It can be argued that at 

least  half  the  sample  has  manifested  considerable  resilience”  (Dahlin  et  al.,  1990,  p. 

231). 

Research  such  as  this  has  challenged  three  intransigent  ideas  that  have  been  and 

probably still are prevalent in social work and psychology: 

(cid:153) “There are fixed, inevitable, critical, and universal stages of development; 

(cid:153) “Childhood trauma inevitably leads to adult psychopathology…; and 

(cid:153) “There  are  social  conditions, 

interpersonal 

relationships,  and 

institutional 

arrangements that are so toxic they inevitably lead to decrements or problems in the 

everyday  functioning  of  children  and  adults,  families,  and  communities”  (Saleebey, 

1996, p. 299). 

Beliefs such as these, which are indicative of pathogenic thinking, are shattered by the 

discovery that the majority (around 50%) of children who should not develop into well-

adjusted  adults  do  in  fact  just  that.    While  it  is  true  that  childhood  adversity  does 

increase  the  likelihood  of  psychopathology  in  later  life  (Cederblad,  Dahlin,  Hagnell,  & 

Hansson,  1995,  p.  322),  this  adversity  is  also  moderated  by  a  set  of  identifiable 

protective  factors,  such  as  “a  high  sense  of  coherence,  high  mastery,  [and]  an  inner 

locus of control” (ibid.). 

Children who are able to overcome these odds are called resilient.  “Resiliency in children 

is the capacity of those of who are exposed to identifiable risk factors to overcome those 

risks  and  avoid  negative  outcomes  such  as  delinquency  and  behavioral  problems, 

psychological  maladjustment,  academic  difficulties,  and  physical  complications”  (Rak  & 

Patterson, 1996, p. 368).

Research has shown that the following factors are present in resilient children (Benard & 

Marshall, 1997; Bogenschneider, 1996; Butler, 1997; Cederblad et al., 1994; Hawley & 

De  Haan,  1996;  Parker,  Cowen,  Work,  &  Wyman,  1990;  Rutter,  1979;  Werner,  1984, 

1990): 

(cid:153) They  had  an  outgoing,  socially  open,  cooperative,  engaging,  likeable  personality.  

They  were  able,  from  infancy  on,  to  gain  other  people’s  positive  attention.    Their 

behaviour was open, kind and calm. 

(cid:153) The children had good early bonding with their mothers or some other caregiver (eg 

a grandmother, older sister or another relative). 

(cid:153) They  had  a  variety  of  alternative  caregivers  who  played  important  roles  as  positive 

identification models. 

(cid:153) Their mothers had steady employment outside the home. 

(cid:153) They  were  required  to  participate  in  household  chores  and  activities,  ie  ‘required 

helpfulness’. 

(cid:153) There were clearly defined boundaries between subsystems within the family. 

(cid:153) They weren’t colicky.

students positions of trust and responsibility, that provided extramural activities, and 

where teachers were good behaviour models.

(cid:153) They had a high self-esteem. 

(cid:153) They had strict parental supervision. 

(cid:153) They  had  good  positive  coping  skills.    They  had  an  active,  evocative  approach 

towards solving life’s problems, enabling them to negotiate successfully emotionally 

hazardous  experiences.    They  had  flexible  coping  skills  that  could  respond  to  the 

changing environment and their own changing development.

despite unfavourable odds. 

(cid:153) They were autonomous and independent. 

(cid:153) They had special interests and hobbies. 

(cid:153) They had a strong ability to use faith to maintain a positive view of a meaningful life.  

Their  faith  provided  them  with  a  sense  of  rootedness  and  coherence,  a  conviction 

that  their  lives  had  meaning  and  a  belief  that  things  would  work  out  in  the  end 

(cid:153) They were able to ask for support when they needed it. 

Clearly,  children  are  not  defenceless  against  stressful  life  conditions.    There  are  many 

factors  which  can  assist  to  ‘buffer’  (Rutter,  1985)  children  against  stress,  and  which 

assist  them  in  growing  up  to  be  well-adjusted  and  happy  adults,  who  work  well,  play 

well, love well and expect well (Werner in Dahlin et al., 1990, p. 228).  These resilience 

studies stand in contrast to “the overwhelming bulk of developmental research [which] 

has  been  devoted  to  exploring  the  pathogenic  hypothesis,  ie  that  risk  factors  in  the 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 11 

perinatal  period,  infancy  and  early  childhood  are  predictive  of  disturbances  in  later 

childhood and adulthood” (ibid.). 

The theory that has most strongly drawn together studies such as those described so far 

is the theory of salutogenesis, developed by Antonovsky. 

2.3  SALUTOGENESIS 

Aaron  Antonovsky,  a  medical  sociologist,  coined  the  term  ‘salutogenesis’  in  1978 

(Antonovsky,  1998a,  p.  5).    Salutogenesis  “emphasizes  the  origins  of  health,  or 

wellness,  [and  comes  from  the  Latin]:  salus  =  health,  Greek:  genesis  =  origins” 

(Strümpfer,  1990,  p.  263).    Literally  translated  salutogenesis  means  the  ‘origins  of 

health’.  Salutogenesis offers a paradigm for thinking about resilience, illness and health, 

that stands in contrast to the dominant pathogenic paradigm. 

 

 

2.3.1 

PATHOGENESIS 

Pathogenesis, the ‘origins of disease’, has been and largely continues to be the dominant 

model  of  health  and  medicine.    According  to  the  pathogenic  paradigm,  “people  remain 

healthy unless some special bug or combination of bugs ‘is caught’” (Antonovsky, 1998a, 

p. 5).  Pathogenic research and practice is aimed at determining why people become sick 

and  why  certain  people  develop  particular  diseases  (Strümpfer,  1990).    Pathogenesis 

assumes that people normally function in a state of homeostasis and order (Antonovsky, 

1984),  “which  may  vary  somewhat  but  is  maintained  by  various  complexly  interacting 

regulatory  mechanisms”  (Strümpfer,  1990,  p.  264).    When  these  mechanisms  are 

inadequate  to  resist  the  attacks  of  “microbiological,  physical,  chemical,  and/or 

psychosocial stressors, vectors or agents”, disease results (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 114).  

Consequently, these ‘bugs’, be they germs, chemicals or psychosocial stressors, must be 

‘bad’ and should be eradicated or avoided. 

The  central  pathogenic  question  is,  “How  do  stressors  eventuate  in  undesirable  illness 

outcomes?”  (Antonovsky  &  Bernstein,  1986,  p.  53).    In  pathogenic  research,  the 

outcome variable is always illness of some kind.  “Mediating or coping variables” may be 

introduced  as  illness  “buffers”,  increasing  the  validity  of  the  study,  but  the  outcome 

variable is always illness (ibid.). 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 12 

The  pathogenic  paradigm  has  had  six  primary  consequences  for  research  and  clinical 

practice (Antonovsky, 1984): 

(cid:153) Health  versus  Disease.    “We  have  come  to  think  dichotomously  about  people, 

classifying  them  as  either  healthy  or  diseased”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  115).    The 

majority  of  people  are  assumed  to  be  in  the  healthy  category,  and  a  minority  of 

people,  the  “deviants”  or  “abnormals”,  are  in  the  diseased  category  (Antonovsky, 

1979, p. 48). 

(cid:153) Specific Focus on Pathogen.  “Thinking pathogenically, we have almost inevitably 

taken as our focus of concern a specific pathologic entity: heart disease, or cancer, or 

schizophrenia”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  115).    The  researcher  or  practitioner  focuses 

exclusively  on  that  disease  and  only  that  disease  (Antonovsky  &  Bernstein,  1986).  

Only  phenomena  that  are  thought  to  contribute  directly  to  that  disease  are 

considered.  Other phenomena, which may be common to various diseases, either as 

causes or solutions, tend to be ignored due to the high level of specialisation of the 

practitioner (Antonovsky, 1984). 

(cid:153) Disease Causation.  “The pathogenic paradigm has constrained us to search for the 

cause  or,  if  enlightened  by  the  concept  of  multifactorial  causation,  the  causes  of 

disease  X”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  115).    Since  the  pathogenic  paradigm  assumes 

that  people  function  in  a  state  of  homeostasis,  it  comes  as  a  surprise  to  find 

pathogens and all energy is devoted to the study of these pathogens.  Practitioners 

who  think  pathogenically  are  unaware  that  stress  and  pathogens  are  ubiquitous.  

Consequently, they focus on how these stressors function, rather than on how people 

cope  with  them.    Stated  differently,  “When  one’s  focus  is  on  an  undesirable 

dependent  variable,  one’s  thinking  tends  to  be  oriented  to  studying  undesirable 

independent variables” (Antonovsky & Bernstein, 1986, p. 64). 

(cid:153) Stressors  are  Bad.    “Stressors,  by  definition,  are  viewed  as  pathogenic” 

(Antonovsky & Bernstein, 1986, p. 64).  The goal of pathogenically oriented practice 

is  to  eradicate  all  stressors,  since  stress  is  believed  to  inevitably  lead  to  disease.  

“Our goal has become the creation of a sterile environment,” free of all stressors and 

pathogens (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 115). 

(cid:153) Illusion of Health.   “The  pathogenic paradigm underlies the ambience that Dubos 

(1960) has so cogently warned against, ‘the mirage of health’” (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 

115).    Wars  are  waged  against  various  diseases,  with  the  assurances  that  the 

diseases can and have been conquered.  This results in a false belief that disease and 
Page 13 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

its  biological  causes  can  be  eradicated.    The  behavioural  components  involved  in 

disease  prevention  and  health  promotion  are  of  little  consideration  and  receive 

minimal  funding.    Nevertheless,  despite  enormous  efforts  to  eradicate  disease, 

unhealth remains. 

(cid:153) Group Statistics.  “Pathogenesis has given overwhelming priority to the case or, in 

considering  prevention,  to  the  high-risk  group.  It  tends  to 

ignore  what 

methodologists  call  deviant  cases”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  116).    Researchers’ 

emphasis on group statistics results in satisfaction once “we have established that we 

can account for so and so much of the variance”, even though only a portion of the 

variance  is  actually  explained  (Antonovsky  &  Bernstein,  1986,  p.  65).    Group 

statistics  prevent  an  examination  of  the  “successful  coper”  or  “deviant  case”  who, 

despite the prediction of disease, resists disease.  “Children of schizophrenic parents 

who do not become schizophrenic do not interest us, because we are tuned in to the 

specific disease.  They may all have been killed in traffic accidents, but that is not our 

turf.    Because  we  do  not  study  the  deviants,  however,  we  generate  neither 

hypotheses nor methodologies to help us understand the full gamut of human health” 

(Antonovsky, 1984, p. 116). 

 

2.3.2 

THE SALUTOGENIC QUESTION 

“Salutogenesis makes a fundamentally different philosophical assertion about the world 

than does pathogenesis” (Antonovsky, 1998a, p. 5).  Salutogenesis asks a question that 

is  unheard of  in  pathogenic  circles.    In  a  1971  study  on  concentration  camp  survivors, 

Antonovsky and his colleagues (cited in Antonovsky & Bernstein, 1986) write: 

Our  data  are  very  consistent  in  showing  that  middle-aged  Israeli  women  of  central 
European origin who were concentration camp survivors are, as a group, more poorly 
adapted … than are the women in a control group. …  What is, however, of greater 
fascination and of human and scientific import … is the fact that a not-inconsiderable 
number  of  concentration  camp  survivors were  found  to  be  well-adapted.    …   What, 
we  must  ask,  has  given  these  women  the  strength,  despite  their  experience,  to 
maintain what would seem to be the capacity not only to function well, but even to 
be happy [italics added].  (p. 52) 

Where the pathogenic paradigm asks, “Why do people get ill?” the salutogenic paradigm 

asks, “Why, when people are exposed to the same stress which causes some to become 

ill, do some remain healthy?”  (see Antonovsky, 1979, p. 56; Antonovsky, 1984, p. 117; 

Strümpfer, 1990, p. 267)

The salutogenic paradigm has six primary consequences for research and clinical practice 

(Antonovsky, 1984): 

(cid:153) Health  as  a  Continuum.    “Salutogenesis  open  the  way  for  a  continuum 

conceptualization of what I have called health ease-dis-ease” (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 

116).    Rather  than  categorising  people  as either  healthy  or  diseased,  salutogenesis 

posits  that  people  fall  on  a  continuum  somewhere  between  these  two  poles,  which 

can be termed ease and dis-ease.  Although people towards the dis-ease end of the 

continuum  will  require  more  intensive  biopsychosocial  intervention,  the  salutogenic 

questions  asks,  “Why  does  this  person  –  wherever  he  or  she  is  located  on  the 

continuum – move toward the healthy pole?” (Antonovsky, 1984) 

(cid:153) Broad  Focus  on  Health.    We  no  longer  focus  exclusively  on  one  or  other  specific 

disease  entity.    Rather,  the  salutogenic  paradigm  requires  researchers  and 

practitioners to focus broadly on a variety of general factors that promote movement 

towards  health,  irrespective  of  the  specific  dis-ease  being  experienced  by  an 

individual (Antonovsky, 1984). 

(cid:153) Health  Causation.    In  contrast  with  the  emphasis  on  how  specific  diseases  are 

caused,  salutogenesis  focuses  on  the  causes  or  origins  of  wellness  (Antonovsky, 

1984): 

Assuming  that  stressors  are  ubiquitous,  we  turn  our  attention  away  from  the 
potential pathogen and from the specific answer to a given pathogen and become 
concerned,  in  research  and  in  practice,  with  the  resources  that  are  valuable  in 
coping with a wide range of pathogens and stressors.  (p. 116) 

(cid:153) “Only  by  focusing  on  health  can  we  make  advances  in  developing  a  broad-range 

theory of successful coping that derives from familiarity with a wide range of studies 

on different diseases and health outcomes” (Antonovsky & Bernstein, 1986, p. 64). 

(cid:153) Stressors  can  be  Good.    Stress,  while  undeniably  having  some  negative 

consequences, can also have salutary consequences: “A stressor may be a challenge, 

giving  rise  to  successful  coping  precisely  because  it  makes  unanticipated  demands” 

(Antonovsky & Bernstein, 1986, p. 64).  Stress is part of our human existence and 

must be dealt accordingly (Antonovsky, 1984): 

We avoid hysteria about stressors and the gimmicks and instant cures that often 
accompany such hysteria.  The question becomes not “How can we eradicate this 
or that stressor?” but “How can we learn to live, and live well, with stressors, and 
possibly even turn their existence to our advantage?”  (p. 116)  

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 15 

(cid:153) Struggle  for  Adaptation.    “Recognition  of  the  limited  utility  of  wars  against 

diseases  X,  Y,  and  Z,  of  the  search  for  utopia,  leads  us  to  focus  on  the  overall 

problem  of  adaptation,  of  the  perpetual  struggle  for  sources  of  adaptation” 

(Antonovsky, 1984, p. 117).  This raises the study of health and the clinical practice 

of  development  and  growth  to  the  same  status  as  the  study  of  disease  and  the 

practice of disease prevention.  The combination of these two forces will assist in the 

movement towards the health end of the ease-dis-ease continuum. 

(cid:153) Deviant Cases.  “The salutogenic paradigm continually focuses on the deviants, on 

those who make it against the high odds that human existence poses.  It posits that 

we  all,  by  virtue  of  being  human,  are  in  a  high-risk  group”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p. 

117).  By studying these few deviant cases (although in some instances they may be 

in  the  majority),  which  pathogenic  research  overlooks,  we  all  learn  how  to  become 

more resilient. 

Antonovsky and Bernstein (1986) are, however, quick to point out that the salutogenic 

paradigm is not intended to replace the pathogenic one: 

A friend once remarked, “When I have cancer, I want to be treated for cancer, not 
for  the  sense  of  coherence.”    Our  thesis  is  that  she  should  also  be  treated  for  the 
sense  of  coherence  –  or  whatever  salutogenic  variable  turns  out  to  be  a  powerful 
predictor of health.  Nor is it enough to ask, “Who doesn’t get disease X?”  For, as we 
have  noted,  one  may  get  disease  Y,  which  may  be  as  serious  as  disease  X.    The 
salutogenic  alternative  is  intended  to  add  the  study  of  health  to  the  study  of 
diseases.  (p. 64) 

Antonovsky’s  work  focused  specifically  on  the  issue  of  physical  health  (Antonovsky, 

1979): 

My point is that by defining health as coextensive with the many other dimensions of 
well-being, one makes the concept of health meaningless an impossible to study.  It 
is,  of  course,  folly  to  deny  the  interaction  between  health  well-being  and  other 
dimensions.  …  But the nature of this relationship is one that must be subjected to 
theoretical  clarification  and  empirical  investigation.    Health  well-being  must  be 
measured separately.  (p. 68) 

Yet  despite  such  assertions,  in  the  same  book  he  adopts  Dubos’  definition  of  health 

(Antonovsky,  1979,  p.  53),  “A  modus  vivendi  enabling  imperfect  men  to  achieve  a 

rewarding and not too painful existence while they cope with an imperfect world.”   

Strümpfer  (1995,  p.  81)  notes  “that  Antonovsky  struggled  with  a  much  more 

encompassing  problem  [than  merely  physical  health],  namely  that  of  the  sources  of 

strength  in  general.”    In  response  to  this,  Strümpfer  proposes  the  term  ‘fortigenesis’ 

(ibid.): 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 16 

The term “fortigenesis”, from Latin: fortis (= strong), seems to be more descriptive 
of  the  paradigm  than  the  term  ‘salutogenesis’.    The  English  words,  fortify  (=  to 
impart physical strength, vigour or endurance, or to strengthen mentally or morally), 
fort (= a fortified place), and fortitude (= strength and courage in adversity or pain), 
all have the same root.  Introducing the construct is not to deny the need to search 
for  the  origins  of  health;  it  is  merely  to  say  that,  in  the  process  of  doing  so, 
Antonovsky  could  not  help  but  point  to  the  closely  related  origins  of  the  strength 
needed  to  be  effective  at  other  end-points  of  human  functioning  too.    This  total 
endeavour should be acknowledged: “fortigenesis” is more embracing, more holistic, 
than “salutogenesis”.  (p. 82) 

Owing  to  the  long  history  of  the  term  ‘salutogenesis’  and  in  light  of  the  broad  way  in 

which  the  term  has  been  used  by  psychologists,  medical  practitioners,  nurses, 

educationalists  and  social  workers,  I  have  opted  to  retain  the  term  ‘salutogenesis’.  

Despite  both  Antonovsky’s 

reservations  and  Strümpfer’s  astute  observations, 

‘salutogenesis’ has come to mean the ‘origins of health’, where health is broadly defined 

as  “a  state  of  complete  physical,  mental,  and  social  well-being  and  not  merely  the 

absence of disease or infirmity” (World Health Organization, cited in Antonovsky, 1979, 

p. 52). 

 

2.3.3 

THE SALUTOGENIC MODEL OF HEALTH 

Antonovsky’s studies concerning the origins of health led him to propose the Salutogenic 

Model  of  Health  (Figure  2.1).    This  model  illustrates  how  various  components  work 

together  leading  to  a  prediction  of  an  individual’s  position  along  the  ease-dis-ease 

continuum.    The  following  discussion,  which  clarifies  the  important  components  of  the 

model, is summarised from Chapter 7 of Antonovsky’s Health, Stress, and Coping (1979, 

pp. 182-197). 

(cid:153) Sense  of  Coherence.    Antonovsky’s  notion  of  ‘Sense  of  Coherence’  is  the  central 

tenet  of  his  salutogenic  paradigm  and  will  be  discussed  in  greater  depth  in  the 

following section.  He says (Antonovsky, 1979): 

I start the discussion from the sense of coherence.  This is, after all, the core of 
my  answer  to  the  problem  of  salutogenesis.    The  sense  of  coherence  is 
measurable;  each  of  us  is  located  at  some  point  on  the  sense-of-coherence 
continuum, which can be seen as an ordinal scale.  (p. 183) 

(cid:153) Life Experiences.  Arrow A in Figure 2.1 indicates the importance of life experiences 

in  the  development  of  a  sense  of  coherence.    “The  more  these  experiences  are 

characterized by consistency, participation in shaping outcome, and an underload-

overload  balance  of  stimuli,  the  more  we begin  to  see  the  world  as  being  coherent 

and  predictable”  (Antonovsky,  1979,  p.  187).    The  foundations  of  the  sense  of 

coherence  are  laid  in  childhood,  during  one’s  formative  life  experience,  but  can 

change  throughout  life  in  response  to  significant  cataclysmic  life  events  or  through 

personal development and growth. 

(cid:153) Generalised Resistance Resources.  Generalised Resistance Resources (GRRs) are 

the factors give life experiences the qualities of “consistency, participation in shaping 

outcome and neither underload nor overload” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 189).  GRRs, by 

definition, provide a person with life experiences that are meaningful and coherent.  

The  relationship  between  life  experiences  and  GRRs  is  not  causal,  hence  Line  C  in 

Figure  2.1  is  a  line  and  not  an  arrow.    GRRs  are  the  ingredients  that  mix  together 

with life experiences to influence one’s sense of coherence. 

(cid:153) Sources  of  GRRs.    As  indicated  by  Arrow  E,  GRRs  are  rooted  in  still  earlier 

experiences  that  are  located  within  a  sociocultural  and  historical  context.    One’s 

position  in  society  affords  one  certain  opportunities  and  conditions  –  some  better, 

some worse.  These conditions affect the repertoire of and the type of GRRs that can 

develop.  In  particular,  they  influence  child  rearing  patterns  and  social-role 

complexes.    There  are  other  factors,  however,  which  are  not  subject  to  context: 

idiosyncratic factors such as an individual’s personality, appearance, intelligence, etc 

as well as chance factors influence the development of GRRs.  While people who are 

poor  or  isolated  from  participating  in  society  have  fewer  opportunities  to  develop 

GRRs, they are not completely without opportunity. 

(cid:153) Stressors.    Although  the  sense  of  coherence  occupies  the  central  position  of  the 

Salutogenic Model, stressors occupy the most ‘busy’ position.  Arrow F indicates that 

the sources of GRRs (as discussed in the previous paragraph) influence the kinds of 

stressors present in an individual’s experience.  Arrow B indicates that stressors can 

profoundly influence one’s GRRs by introducing unexpected experiences that promote 

or  shake  one’s  GRRs.    Arrow  G  indicates  that  traumatic  physical  or  biochemical 

stressors  (such  as  poison,  a  bullet  or  a  car)  affect  one’s  position  on  the  health 

continuum  directly.    Arrow  H  indicates  that  prolonged  exposure  to  physical  and 

biochemical  stressors  can  indirectly  affect  one’s  health  through  interaction  with 

potential  pathogens  and  one’s  state  of  stress.    Arrow  L  indicates  that  the  stressors 

place one in a state of tension. 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review

(cid:153) Management  of  Tension.    Arrow  I  indicates  that  advances  in  preventive  and 

remedial  medicine  have  increased  society’s  capacity  to  reduce,  restrict  or  remove 

some of the stressors.  Of course, “the bugs … are smarter” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 

193)  making  such  measures  inadequate  to  ensure  health.    Arrow  D  indicates  how 

sense  of  coherence  enables  the  management  of  tension  that  arises  from  the 

stressors  by  mobilising  the  GRRs  and  also  other  Specific  Resistance  Resources 

(SRRs).  The mobilised GRRs can then be used in three main ways.  Firstly, as can be 

seen by Line J, one can avoid the stressors completely.  Secondly, Line K indicates 

that  certain  stressors  can  be  redefined  “as  innocuous  or  even  as  welcome”  (ibid.).  

Thirdly, as Arrow M indicates, the GRRs enable one to manage one’s state of tension 

by holding the stress or by overcoming the stressor (see the previous discussion on 

Pearlin  and  Schooler’s  (1982)  three  types  of  coping  which  are  relevant  here).  

Successful  efforts  to  manage  the  state  of  tension  contribute  to  one’s  sense  of 

coherence  (Arrow  N),  by  enabling  one  to  “learn  that  existence  is  neither  shattering 

nor meaningless” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 194). 

(cid:153) Stress.    The  successful  management  of  stress  contributes  to  one’s  sense  of 

coherence  (Arrow  N)  and  also  maintains  one’s  position  along  the  health  continuum 

(Arrow  O).    Unsuccessful  management  of  tension  contributes  to  a  state  of  stress, 

which,  together  with  the  indirect  work  of  stressors  and  the  activation  of  potential 

pathogens,  leads  to  illness  (Arrow  P).    Arrow  Q  indicates  that  the  pathogens  that 

‘cause’  illness  do  so  only  in  interaction  with  a  state  of  stress.    This  suggests  that, 

“other than the massive traumata that leave none unscathed (Arrow G), all diseases 

are  usefully  understood  as  psychosomatic.    In  other  words,  almost  all  breakdown 

involves stress.  Stress, however, does not determine the particular expression of the 

breakdown” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 196). 

(cid:153) Health.  One’s position on the health or ease/dis-ease continuum is the final stage of 

the  Salutogenic  Model.    One’s  health  status  acts  on  one’s  life  experiences  in  three 

main ways.  Firstly, Arrow G indicates that one’s health status influences the kinds of 

stressors one is exposed to.  Secondly, Arrow R indicates that “good health is in itself 

a  significant  generalized  resistance  resource  by  the  definition  of  a  GRR  as  a  factor 

that  fosters  meaningful  and  sensible  life  experiences”  (Antonovsky,  1979,  p.  197).  

Thirdly, being healthy “can facilitate the acquisition of other GRRs” (ibid.). 

In short, childrearing patterns and social-role complexes build up generalised resistance 

resources  (Arrow  E),  which  provide  one  with  sets  of  meaningful,  coherent  life 

experiences (Line C) which shape an individual’s sense of coherence (Arrow A).  When 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 20 

one is exposed to life stress, one enters a state of tension (Arrow L).  A strong sense of 

coherence  mobilises  one’s  available  GRRs  (Arrow  D),  which  interact  with  the  state  of 

tension  to  hold  the  stress  and  overcome  the  stressor  (Arrow  M).    Successful 

management  of  the  tension  boosts  one’s  sense  of  coherence  (Arrow  N)  and  maintains 

one’s position towards the health end of the ease/dis-ease continuum (Arrow O). 

 

2.4  SENSE OF COHERENCE 

2.4.1 

INTRODUCTION TO SOC 

As the previous section will have made clear, ‘Sense of Coherence’ (SOC) is the central 

contribution of Antonovsky’s salutogenic theorising.  Antonovsky’s research investigated 

the source of resilience and found the GRRs.  Further research indicated that GRRs were 

mobilised  by  another  construct,  namely  SOC  (Antonovsky,  1998b).    Ongoing  research 

provided  ample  evidence  to  support  the  notion  that  people’s  SOC  contributed 

substantially to their resilience and health. 

Before unpacking what SOC is, it is important to clarify what it is not.  It is not a specific 

coping style or method or resource.  It is rather a general approach to life that enables 

the mobilisation of specific coping resources (Antonovsky, 1998a): 

Much as salutogenesis is a very broad construct, seeking to understand health rather 
than any given diagnostic category of disease, so the SOC is, in two senses, broader 
than the coping resources that have been studied.  First, it is most emphatically not a 
coping style or a substantive resource.  The crucial idea is that, since people confront 
such a wide variety of bugs, no specific style or resource is ever appropriate all the 
time.    The  person  with  a  strong  SOC,  believing  that  she  or  he  understands  the 
problem  and  sees  it  as  a  challenge,  will  select  what  is  believed  to  be  the  most 
appropriate  tool  for  the  task  at  hand.    Second,  the  SOC  distills  the  core  of  specific 
coping or resistance resources (money, social support, mastery, a confidant, a belief 
in God, and so on), and expresses what they have in common: they enhance one’s 
sense  of  comprehensibility,  manageability,  and  meaningfulness.    In  this  way,  the 
SOC offers an explanation of how these resources may contribute to health.  (p. 8) 

SOC was originally defined as follows (Antonovsky, 1979): 

The sense of coherence is a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one 
has  a  pervasive,  enduring  though  dynamic  feeling  of  confidence  that  one’s  internal 
and  external  environments  are  predictable  and  that  there  is  a  high  probability  that 
things will work out as well as can reasonably be expected.  (p. 123) 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 21 

Ongoing  research  led  Antonovsky  to  identify  three  main  components  of  SOC,  viz: 

comprehensibility,  manageability  and  meaningfulness.    This  resulted  in  a  reformulation 

of the original definition (1987, cited in Antonovsky, 1998b): 

A global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring 
though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one’s internal 
and  external  environments  in  the  course  of  living  are  structured,  predictable,  and 
explicable;  (2)  the  resources  are  available  to  one  to  meet  the  demands  posed  by 
these  stimuli;  and  (3)  these  demands  are  challenges,  worthy  of  investment  and 
engagement (Antonovsky, 1987, p. 19).  (p. 22) 

These three components can be discussed in more detail: 

(cid:153) Comprehensibility.    The  comprehensibility  component  of  SOC  is  what  was  most 

strongly emphasised by the original 1979 definition of SOC, viz “the extent to which 

individuals  perceive  the  stimuli  that  confront  them  as  making  cognitive  sense,  as 

information that is ordered, consistent, structured, and clear – and, hence, regarding 

the  future,  as  predictable  –  rather  than  as  noisy,  chaotic,  disordered,  random, 

accidental,  and  unpredictable”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  118).    Comprehensibility  is 

primarily  a  cognitive  dimension,  referring  to  how  the  individual  thinks  about  or 

makes sense of a set of internal or external stimuli or situations.  It implies that life, 

which  is  currently  comprehensible,  is  expected  to  comprehensible  in  the  future.    It 

also  implies  that,  although  one  may  undergo  great  difficulties,  challenges  and 

complex situations, there is a fundamental conviction that these situations will make 

sense. 

(cid:153) Manageability.    Manageability  is  “the  extent  of  the  belief  that  not  only  did  one 

understand  the  problem,  but  that  the  requisite  resources  to  cope  with  the  problem 

successfully were at one’s disposal” (Antonovsky, 1998a, p. 7).  It may appear that 

manageability  refers  to  the  sense  that  life  is  'under  my  control’  and  that  it  is  thus 

equivalent  to  Rotter’s  Locus  of  Control  (to  be  discussed  further  in  a  later  section).  

However,  Antonovsky  (1984)  argues  that  Locus  of  Control  and  Manageability  are 

quite different constructs: 

“At one’s disposal” may refer to resources under one’s own control – the … Rotter 
understanding – but it may also refer to resources controlled by legitimate others 
– friends, colleagues, God, history – upon whom one can count.  No implication 
exists that untoward things do not happen in life.  They do; but when people are 
high on manageability, they have the sense that, aided by their own resources or 
by those of legitimate others, they will be able to cope and not grieve endlessly.  
Moreover, there will be no sense of being victimized by events or of being treated 
unfairly by life.  (p. 119) 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 22 

(cid:153) The  concept  of  ‘legitimate  others’  introduces  the  notion  that  being  tied  into  a 

meaningful social network promotes one’s resilience, a subject that will be addressed 

in greater depth later. Strümpfer (1990, p. 269) notes “that the mere perception that 

help  is  available  may  operate  [to  enhance  resilience],  without  any  actual  support 

being provided.” 

(cid:153) Meaningfulness.    Meaningfulness  is  the  emotional  face  of  comprehensibility 

(Antonovsky, 1984).  While comprehensibility means that life makes cognitive sense, 

meaningfulness means that life is emotionally worthwhile and sensible.  In this way, 

meaningfulness  accounts  for  an  individual’s  motivation  to  engage  in  a  difficult  life 

situation (Antonovsky, 1998a).  To say that life is meaningful is to say that one cares 

(Antonovsky,  1984).    When  a  difficult  situation  is  perceived  as  meaningful,  one 

chooses  to  invest  emotional  energy  in  dealing  with  it,  one  sees  the  difficulty  as  a 

challenge  in  which  it  is  worth  investing  energy  and  commitment,  rather  than  as  a 

burden (ibid.). 

An individual who had a weak Sense of Coherence would thus (Strümpfer, 1990): 

Perceive  internal  and  external  stimuli  as  noise,  not  information,  as  inexplicable 
disorder  and  chaos,  and  as  unpredictable  in  future;  (s)he  would  experience  the 
events  of  life  as  unfortunate  things  that  happen  to  her/him  and  victimize  her/him 
unfairly;  and  (s)he  would  feel  that  nothing  in  life  mattered  much,  or  worse,  are 
unwelcome demands and wearisome burdens. (p. 269) 

By contrast, the person with a strong SOC (Cederblad et al., 1994): 

Confronting  stressors,  is  capable  of  clarifying  and  structuring  the  nature  of  the 
stressor, believes that the appropriate resources are available and can be mobilized 
to  deal  successfully  with  the  challenge,  and  is  motivated  to  deal  with  it.    Such  an 
orientation to life … allows the selection of appropriate coping strategies and provides 
a solid base for maintenance and strengthening of health and well being.  (pp. 2-3) 

2.4.2 

DETAILS CONCERNING SOC 

In  his  various  writings,  Antonovsky  unpacks  a  number  of  important  details  concerning 

Sense of Coherence: 

 

 

 

 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 23 

2.4.2.1 

SOC is a Paradigm 

SOC  is  a  personal  paradigm.    Inasmuch  as  salutogenesis  is  a  paradigm,  a  “set  of 

fundamental beliefs inaccessible to empirical validation” (Strümpfer, 1990, p. 263), SOC 

is a personal paradigm that indicates an individual’s global outlook on life (Antonovsky, 

The sense of coherence explicitly and unequivocally is a generalized, long-lasting way 
of  seeing  the  world  and  one’s  life  in  it.    It  is  perceptual,  with  both  cognitive  and 
affective components.  Its referent is not this or that area of life, this or that problem 
or situation, this or that time, or, in our terms, this or that stressor.  It is, I suggest, 
a  crucial  element  in  the  basic  personality  structure  of  an  individual  and  in  the 
ambiance of a subculture, culture, or historical period.  (p. 124) 

1979): 

 

2.4.2.2 

SOC is Dynamic 

Antonovsky  assumes  that  SOC  is  established  by  about  age  30  and  thereafter  remains 

stable (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 118).  A person who enters adulthood with a strong SOC 

will  tend  to  generate  life  experiences  that  reinforce,  even  promote,  their  SOC.    Even 

catastrophic life events will, most likely, be survived with SOC remaining intact.  On the 

other  hand,  a  person  whose  life  experiences  during  the  first  30  years  are  marked  by 

chaos  will  enter  adulthood  with  a  weak  SOC.    It  is  unlikely  that  even  regular  SOC 

enhancing  life  experiences  will  fundamentally  alter  their  SOC.    “By  and  large  …  the 

person  with  a  weak  SOC  in  adulthood  will  manifest  a  cyclical  pattern  of  deteriorating 

health and a weakening SOC” (Antonovsky, 1998a, p. 15).  Antonovsky is arguing that 

people with high SOC get more SOC, while people with low SOC get less. 

However, Antonovsky points out that his position is theoretical not empirical, and that he 

has no evidence to substantiate his argument (Antonovsky, 1998a).  He also argues that 

SOC  is  dynamic  and  can  change  during  an  individual’s  life  course.    “I  certainly  am  not 

committed  to  understanding  the  sense  of  coherence  as  being  determined  forever  and 

anon  by  genes  or  early  childhood  experience.    It  is  shaped  and  tested,  reinforced  and 

modified  not  only  in  childhood  but  throughout  one’s  life”  (Antonovsky,  1979,  p.  125).  

He suggests that “change, even significant change, can occur if people can be enabled to 

alter  their  lives  significantly,  encouraging  SOC-enhancing  experiences  to  occur  with 

greater frequency over a sustained period” (Flick & Homan, 1998, p. 109). 

Antonovsky’s somewhat contradictory statements regarding the stability and dynamism 

of SOC are not well resolved.  There is little research pointing to ways to enhance SOC.  

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 24 

There is also little research indicating the degree to which a weak SOC can be bolstered 

and  substantially  improved.    In  1998,  Antonovsky  stated  that  the  “developmental 

dynamics  of  the  sense  of  coherence”  was  one  of  three  important  areas  for  ongoing 

research, indicating this to be an unresolved issue. 

 

2.4.2.3 

Boundaries 

SOC is the view that a person has about the world around him/her.  It does not follow, 

however,  that  the  person  must  view  the  entire  world  as  comprehensible,  manageable 

and  meaningful.    Antonovsky’s  research  found  that  people  draw  boundaries  within  the 

objective world – provided those things which fall within the boundaries are considered 

coherent  the  person  will  have  a  strong  SOC,  irrespective  of  the  coherence  of  things 

outside  the  boundaries.    “Quite  conceivably,  people  might  feel  that  they  have  little 

interest in national government or international politics, little competence in manual (or 

cognitive  or  aesthetic)  skills,  little  concern  for  local  volunteer  groups  or  trade  union 

activity, and so on, and yet have a strong SOC” (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 119). 

This  is  similar  to  Covey’s  notion  of  circles  of  concern  and  influence  (Covey,  Merrill,  & 

Merrill,  1994,  p.  150).    The  ‘circle  of  concern’  refers  to  everything  about  which  one  is 

concerned.    Things  outside  of  the  circle  of  concern  are  of  no  importance  to  that 

individual.  Within the circle of concern is a smaller circle, the ‘circle of influence’, which 

refers  to  those  things  which  concern  that  individual  and  over  which  that  individual  has 

some  influence.    Covey’s  point  is  that  being  concerned  about  something  does  not  give 

one influence over it.  By focusing on the area between the two circles (ie those things 

which  concern  one  but  over  which  one  has  no  influence)  one  creates  SOC  reducing 

experiences, since the situation is not manageable.  In this regard, Antonovsky (1984, p. 

119)  asks,  “First,  is  there  at  least  some  part  of  my  life  that  does  matter  very  much, 

which  I  care  about  [ie  the  circle  of  concern]?    Second,  within  these  boundaries,  are 

stimuli  meaningful,  comprehensible,  and  manageable  [ie  the  circle  of  influence]?”    By 

focusing on issues within the circle of influence, one is assured of life experiences that 

are coherent, and in so doing, one can (theoretically) expand the circle of influence. 

Of course, a person may have a very small circle of concern and an even smaller circle of 

influence,  yielding  a  life  that  is  very  limited  in  scope  although  potentially  high  in  SOC.  

Not everything can be left out of the circle of influence, however (Strümpfer, 1990): 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 25 

Antonovsky (1987) maintained that there are four spheres that cannot be excluded if 
the  person  is  to  maintain  a  strong  SOC,  namely,  his/her  own  feelings,  immediate 
interpersonal relations, the major sphere of activity (work, really) and the existential 
issues of death, inevitable failures, shortcomings, conflict and isolation.  (p. 269) 

 

2.4.2.4 

SOC and Values 

It  is  tempting  to  think  that  people  with  high  SOC  will  be  principled  people  with 

humanitarian values.  This, however, is not so.  “A person with a strong SOC might well 

be  a  terrible  person  in  terms  of  my  (or  your)  values;  …  a  Nazi  or  …  a  highly 

manipulative,  unscrupulous  academic,  or  a  member  of  an  extreme  religious  sect” 

(Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  120).    In  this  way,  SOC  is  value  neutral  and  is  simply  a  world-

view that tends to promote an individual’s health in the face of life stressors. 

 

 

2.4.2.5 

SOC and Work 

Given that the workplace is where most people spend a large percentage of their waking 

hours, the relationship between SOC and work is an area of interest.  Strümpfer  (1990) 

has studied this area extensively and says that having high SOC will result in the person: 

Making cognitive sense of the workplace, perceiving its stimulation as clear, ordered, 
structured, consistent and predictable information; 

Perceiving  his/her  work  as  consisting  of  experiences  that  are  bearable,  with  which 
(s)he  can  cope,  and  as  challenges  that  (s)he  can  meet  by  availing  him-/herself  of 
personal resources or resources under the control of legitimate others; 

And  making  emotional  and  motivational  sense  of  work  demands,  as  welcome 
challenges, worthy of engaging in and investing his/her energies in.  (p. 270) 

Antonovsky notes that work need not be intrinsically satisfying to be a SOC reinforcing 

experience.  “People may find little joy in their work, but if they feel that the work has a 

meaning  because  it  is  how  they  support  their  family  and  keep  it  functioning  smoothly 

and happily, they can still have a strong SOC” (Antonovsky, 1984, p. 120). 

2.4.2.6 

Coherence and Locus of Control 

Locus  of  Control  implies  that  that  events  are  under  control  of  an  individual,  leading  to 

the phrase ‘sense of control’ or ‘I am in control’.  “The sense of control is totally related 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 26 

to the freedom of the individual to choose among available alternatives and to perceive 

the outcome of the dynamic situation as completely contingent on the choice he or she 

makes” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 153).  Internal locus of control (ibid.): 

Locates  one’s  fate  in  one’s  own  hands.    The  tendency  is  most  ethnocentrically 
powerful to equate sense of coherence, sense of control, and internal locus of control, 
using  the  model  of  the  autonomous  individual  extolled  in  the  litany  of  Western 
societies  since  the  Industrial  Revolution  –  or,  perhaps  more  appropriately,  the 
Protestant Revolution.  This ideological paradigm dominates our own lives and shapes 
our science.  (p. 153) 

Antonovsky strongly argues that the equation of manageability and control is a Western 

and culturally biased practice, where the ego is placed at the centre of the universe and 

where  any  form  of  control  that  is  not  ‘my  control’  is  greatly  mistrusted.    He  draws  a 

distinction  between  the  phrases  “I  am  in  control”  and  “Things  are  under  control” 

(Antonovsky,  1979,  p.  155)  to  illustrate  this  difference.    “I  am  in  control”  is  the 

dominant Western paradigm, while “Things are under control” is a dominant paradigm in 

many  other  cultures.    He  goes  further  to  state  that  in  some  cultures  SOC  is  strongly 

enhanced  by  the  belief  that  things  are  under  the  control  of  a  beneficent  deity  (or 

powerful others) (ibid.). 

The crux, argues Antonovsky, lies in the concept of ‘participation’ (Antonovsky, 1979): 

If  life  offers  one  the  chance  of  confirming  one’s  predestined  salvation  by  doing  the 
prescribed right things, one can have a strong sense of coherence.  Only when there 
is  no  deity,  no  writ,  but  only  meaningless  chaos  does  one’s  only  hope  lie  in  an 
internal locus of control.  There are, then, many cultural roads to a strong sense of 
coherence.  (p. 156) 

The crucial issue is not whether power to determine such outcomes lies in our own 
hands  or  elsewhere.    What  is  important  is  that  the  location  of  power  is  where  it  is 
legitimately supposed to be.  This may be within oneself; it may be in the hands of 
the head of the family, patriarchs, leaders, formal authorities, the party, history, or a 
deity.    The  element  of  legitimacy  assures  one  that  issues  will,  in  the  long  run,  be 
resolved by such authority in one’s own interests.  Thus a strong sense of coherence 
is not at all endangered by not being in control oneself.  (p. 128) 

 

2.4.2.7 

Fake SOC 

It  is  possible  for  a  person  to  have  a  ‘fake  sense  of  coherence’  (Antonovsky,  1979,  p. 

158).    “The  claim  that  everything  is  comprehensible  and  that  all  problems  can  be 

managed suggests a profound underlying anxiety that this not at all the case, a fragile 

covering  that  might  easily  be  rent  apart”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p.  119).    Antonovsky 

continues elsewhere (1979): 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 27 

When  there  is  a  contention  that  all  problems  have  an  answer,  when  challenge  or 
doubt is intolerable, when there is no flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances, 
when  one  claims  to  be  in  control  of  all  things  or  to  understand  everything,  when 
there  is  a  denial  of  sadness,  and  when  there  is  an  incapacity  to  admit  to  the 
uncontrollable  without  being  overwhelmed  –  there  is  a  clear  indication  that  we  are 
confronted by a fake sense of coherence.  (p. 159) 

 

2.4.2.8  Measuring SOC 

In order to operationalise SOC, Antonovsky developed a 29-item scale that measures the 

three  constructs  comprising  SOC.    The  SOC  scale  has  been  used  in  14  languages, 

including  Afrikaans  and  Tswana  (two  African  languages),  and  has  been  completed  by 

almost  10,000  people  (Antonovsky,  1998b,  p.  25).    A  short-form  version  of  the  scale, 

comprising 13 of the 29 questions, is also available but will not be reported on here. 

The  scale  demonstrates  good  levels  of  reliability.    Internal  consistency  measures 

(Cronbach’s  Alpha)  range  from  .82  to  .95,  in  26  studies  using  different  languages  and 

cultures  (although  all  Western)  (Antonovsky,  1998b,  p.  25).    Test-retest  reliability 

coefficients  (appropriate  since SOC  is  conceptualised  as  a  stable  construct)  range  from 

.41 to .55 over a two-year interval, from .52 to .86 over a one-year interval, .80 over six 

months, .80 to .97 over five to six weeks, and .91 over two weeks (ibid., p. 26). 

The scale has also demonstrated good validity.  Evidence for content validity includes the 

fact that the items were carefully selected according to facet theory to cover all aspects 

of  the  SOC  construct  (Antonovsky,  1998b,  p.  27).    Various  studies  are  presented  by 

Antonovsky  which  demonstrate  criterion  validity  by  reporting  appropriate  correlations 

with  theoretically  expected  variables  (ibid.,  pp.  28-33).    Known-groups  validity  studies 

demonstrate that “Czech cancer patients, Israeli young adults with cerebral palsy, New 

Zealand  chronic  pain  patients,  and  older  American  patients  in  Department  of  Veterans 

Affairs  (VA)  clinics”  have  the  lowest  SOC  scores,  while  “kibbutz  members,  American 

university  faculty,  and  Israelis  who  have  reached  on-time  retirement  age”  have  the 

highest SOC scores (ibid., p. 34). 

Although  SOC  comprises  three  components  (comprehensibility,  manageability  and 

meaningfulness),  these  components  are  highly  interrelated  and  “can  really  only  be 

separated  for  analytic  purposes.    Theoretically,  an  individual  can  be  high  on  one 

component  and  low  on  others,  but  this  is  inherently  unstable”  (Antonovsky,  1984,  p. 

120).    For  this  reason,  Antonovsky  argues  that  factor  analysis  of  the  SOC  scale  is 

inappropriate  (Antonovsky,  1998b).    No  factor  analytic  studies  of  the  SOC  scale  have

been  published,  but  a  number  of  unpublished  studies  suggest  that  a  single-factor 

solution provides the best explanation for the item variances (ibid., p. 35). 

 

 

2.4.3 

STUDIES OF SOC 

SOC,  as  with  many  of  the  constructs  that  have  been  developed  regarding  individual 

resilience, was developed primarily to explain health.  Many studies have thus used SOC 

as the independent variable and various measures of physical health as the dependent 

variable.    Most  studies,  however,  have  introduced  a  broader  range  of  dependent 

variables measuring strength or health more holistically defined, and have even moved 

out  of  the  medical/health  field  completely.    More  recent  thinking  has  also  led  to  the 

conception of SOC at family level.  Although this will be more fully discussed later, such 

studies are included here for the sake of completeness. 

2.4.3.1 

Health Narrowly Defined 

Health.  In a small (N=74) prospective study, SOC was effective in predicting the health 

status of a group of employees one year into the future, accounting for 22% to 32% of 

the  variance  in  illness  (Fiorentino  &  Pomazal,  1998,  p.  98).    However,  when  various 

other variables were entered into the multiple regression analyses (eg various resistance 

resources, health practices and stress), SOC did not enter any of the equations. 

Survival of the Chronically Ill.  An initial study (Time I) was conducted with 377 men 

who  were  over  55  years  and  who  had  at  least  one  chronic  condition  (Coe,  Romeis,  & 

Hall, 1998).  Significant correlations were found between SOC and the various measures 

of  health  status  (including  perceived  health  status,  functional  health  status,  nutritional 

status, mental health, etc) (ibid., p. 267).  Five years later (Time II), 199 of the original 

sample  were  again  interviewed.    SOC  (at  Time  I)  was  significantly  correlated  with  the 

various measures of health status (at Time II), indicating the predictive validity of SOC 

regarding  health  (ibid.,  p.  270).    The  Time  I  profile  of  the  199  men  who  were 

interviewed at Time II was compared with the Time I profile of the 90 men who had died 

in  the  interim.    SOC  was  not  found  to  predict  survival  (ibid.,  p.  271);  having  better 

functional  health  status  and living with  one’s spouse  and  children  at  Time  I  were  most 

effective  at  predicting  survival  at  Time  II  (ibid.).    The  researchers  conclude  that  while 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 29 

SOC does not directly influence survival, it may indirectly influence survival through its 

direct predictive effect on health status. 

Cancer  Outcome.    A  study  of  38  cancer  patients  investigated  the  effect  of  SOC  and 

mental  imagery  on  the  immune  system  and  cancer  outcome  (Post-White,  1998).  

Participants were randomly divided into experimental (n=22) and control (n=16) groups, 

the former receiving training in mental imagery.  SOC scores did not differ between the 

two groups and over time (ibid., p. 283), although among the experimental group SOC 

scores correlated with various beliefs of improved health (ibid., p. 284).  Baseline SOC 

also predicted an actual improvement in the immune system over time (ibid.).  Baseline 

SOC  predicted  increased  quality  of  life  and  increased  hope  over  time  (ibid.,  p.  285).  

Baseline  SOC  did  not,  however,  predict  actual  disease  state;  to  the  contrary,  greater 

baseline  disease  state  predicted  lower  SOC  scores  (ibid.,  p.  287).    The  researcher 

concluded that “even though SOC did not directly influence disease state, a strong SOC 

did result in better quality of life and a more hopeful state” (ibid.). 

Immune System.  Another study (n=59, American women over 60 years) investigating 

the effects of SOC on the immune system yielded contradictory results (Milanesi et al., 

1998).    SOC  correlated  with  the  various  measures  of  self-reported  health,  did  not 

correlate with cortisal levels (a physiological measure of stress) and correlated with only 

one of several measures of the immune system.  The authors (ibid.) conclude: 

That  no  significant  negative  correlations  appeared  between  the  summated  SOC 
scores and cortisal raises the possibility that perceived coping with perceived stress 
constitutes  the  major  operating  factor  in  the  sense  of  coherence  and  that  these 
perceived  experiences  do  not  cover  all  the  actual  stress  and  stress  reduction 
processes operating at the physiological level.  (p. 304) 

 

2.4.3.2 

Health More Broadly Defined 

Mental Health.  In  the  longitudinal  Lundby  study,  148  participants  completed  the  29-

item  SOC  scale.    Cronbach’s  Alpha  was  .89  (Cederblad  et  al.,  1994,  p.  4).    The  scale 

correlated at .44 with the Locus of Control (LOC) scale (being in control of one’s life) and 

at  .59  with  the  Mastery  scale  (being  the  master  of  one’s  fate)  (ibid.).    The  moderate 

correlations  indicate  that  the  three  constructs  are  related  but  not  identical.    The  SOC 

scale did, however, correlate highly with a number of other measures: A correlation of 

.76  was  found  with  the  Quality  of  Life  (QOL)  Scale  which  measures  satisfaction  with 

various  areas  of  life,  and  a  correlation  of  -.70  was  found  with  the  Symptom  Checklist 

(SCL-90) which measures expressions of psychosomatic and emotional distress (Dahlin 
Page 30 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

et al., 1990, p. 231).  This study found that the more salutogenic factors present during 

childhood (eg positive self-esteem, successful coping, trusting relationships, intellectual 

capacity) the better the adult’s mental health and quality of life (Cederblad et al., 1994, 

p. 8).  “Of the nine personal dimensions [including SOC, LOC, mastery, intelligence and 

ways of coping] entered into the multiple regression analyses, the SOC contributed most 

to  the  explained  variance  in  health  measures  [including  QOL,  SCL-90,  the  Health-

Sickness  Rating  Scale  and  rated  health]”  (Cederblad  &  Hansson,  1996,  p.  198).    The 

researchers  propose  a  model  in  which  the  various  salutogenic  factors  contribute  to  the 

development of high SOC which in turn contributes to better mental health (Cederblad et 

al., 1994, p. 10). 

Family  Illness.    A  study  of  78  families  in  which  one  adult  had  a  “serious  illness” 

investigated the relationship between a family’s sense of coherence and family quality of 

life in the face of illness (Anderson, 1998).  A multiple regression analysis indicated that 

57.6%  of  family  quality  of  life  was  accounted  for  by  the  family’s  sense  of  coherence, 

“illness stress, family system balance, length of family relationship, patient full time job 

status and family income”, with family sense of coherence being the “largest predictor” 

(ibid.,  p.  179).    The  researcher  concludes  that  family  sense  of  coherence  was  “an 

important  mediator  in  the  impact  of  illness  stress  on  the  family,  reducing  the  direct 

influence of the illness stress on family quality of life by half” (ibid., p. 182). 

Cystic  Fibrosis.    A  study  of  123  adolescents  with  Cystic  Fibrosis  investigated  the 

various  factors  (including  SOC)  that  contribute  to  self-care,  defined  as  “the  practice  of 

activities  that  individuals  initiate  and  perform  on  their  own  behalf  in  maintaining  life, 

health, and well-being” (Baker, 1998, p. 146).  SOC was found to correlate significantly 

(p<.001)  with  the  various  ‘power  components’  which  which  enable  specific  health-

promoting  practices,  viz.  eg  “ego  strength,  valuing  of  health,  health  knowledge  and 

decision-making  capability,  attention  to  health,  energy,  and  the  ability  to  talk  about 

one’s  feelings”  (ibid.,p.  164).    SOC  also  correlated  significantly  (r=.76,  p<.001)  with 

self-care  (ibid.,p.  165),  and  also  was  a  significant  predictor  of  self-care  in  the  multiple 

regression  analyses.      The  researcher  concludes  that  “having  a  sense  of  coherence  is 

very important to the self-care of adolescents with cystic fibrosis” (ibid.,p. 167). 

Single Parents of Disabled Children.  A study of 152 single mothers who had children 

with a variety of developmental disabilities sought to understand what factors help such 

mothers cope (Gottlieb, 1998).  Results indicated that mothers with higher SOC scores 

tended to report fewer child behavioural problems, fewer recent and potentially stressful 

family  experiences,  greater  family  cohesion  and  adaptability,  larger  social  support 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 31 

networks,  greater  parenting  satisfaction,  less  financial  concern,  less  concern  about 

meeting  their  disabled  child’s  needs,  less  depression,  fewer  health  problems,  greater 

well-being  and  less  parenting  stress  (ibid.).    SOC  was  not  however  related  to  the 

severity of the child’s disability nor the number of disabilities.  The researcher concludes 

that  SOC  is  an  important  variable  in  the  way  single  mothers  cope  with  the  stress  of 

raising a disabled child. 

Successful Aging.  A study of 199 American men aged 55 years and older investigated 

the  role  of  SOC  in  ‘successful  aging’,  measured  as  a  composite  of  psychological,  social 

and  physical  well-being  or  health  (Brooks,  1998).    SOC  was  found  to  correlate 

significantly with the various measures of successful aging, with a correlation of r=-.50 

with physical health (ibid., p. 235).  Even when the correlations were controlled for age, 

income,  education,  occupation  and  past  health,  the  correlations  (r=.38  with  life 

satisfaction,  r=.26  with  social  health  and  r=.-46  with  physical  health)  remained 

significant at p<.01 (ibid., p. 236).  The researcher concludes that SOC is a significant 

factor in predicting successful aging. 

 

2.4.3.3 

Health Very Broadly Defined 

Coping  with  Recent  Life  Events.    A  study  in  Israel  investigated  the  importance  of 

personal  resources  (specifically  SOC)  and  collective  resources  (belonging  to  a  religious 

kibbutz rather than a nonreligious kibbutz suggested more collective resources) in coping 

(defined  as  maintaining  psychological  well-being,  physical  well-being  and  functional 

status) with recent life events (RLE) (Anson, Carmel, Levenson, Bonneh, & Maoz, 1993).  

Two hundred and thirty people participated in the study.  The personal resource of SOC 

was  much  stronger  in  accounting  for  health  in  the  face  of  RLE  than  either  collective 

resources  or  personal  and  collective  resources  combined.    The  study  did  demonstrate, 

however,  that  “collective  resources  (belonging  to  a  religious  community)  somewhat 

foster  the  development  of  personal  resources  (SOC)”  (Anson  et  al.,  1993,  p.  164).  

Although  the  study  found  a  negative  correlation  between  RLE  and  SOC,  it  was  unclear 

whether  people  with  stronger  SOC  avoided  RLE  or  whether  RLE  tended  to  erode  a 

person’s SOC. 

Coping  with  Job  Demands.    A  small  study  of  20  public  health  nurses  in  Hong  Kong, 

investigated  the  importance  of  SOC  for  the  “perceptions  of  task  characteristics  and  for 

stress perceptions during interruptions” (Shiu, 1998, p. 273).  The study’s methodology 

involved the nurses wearing a watch that randomly signalled them six times per day for 
Page 32 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

seven  days.    Participants  responded  to  80%  of  the  signals,  which  prompted  them  to 

complete a dairy concerning task characteristics, work and family role juggling and the 

effects of these on their mood states.  The results indicated that nurses “with high SOC 

had a greater sense of emotional well-being in the face of occupational stress and work-

family  juggling,  and  were  more  likely  to  perceive  tasks as  progressing  toward the  goal 

and  to  be  within  control”  (ibid.,  p.  278).      The  researcher  concludes  that  SOC  assists 

nurses in coping with the juggling of work and family responsibilities and in coping with 

occupational stressors.  

Job Performance.  In a small retrospective study (sample size not reported), a sample 

of  workers  with  lower  back  pain  was  divided  “into  two  groups  based  solely  on  the 

amount of time lost due to injury”.  Both groups completed the SOC scale.  The “results 

show that the two groups were significantly different in their sense of coherence scores, 

particularly  with  respect  to  the  comprehension  component”  (Association  of  Ontario 

Health Centres, 1995, p. 2).  Although the scientific quality of this study is questionable, 

it suggests that the job performance (attendance) of workers who are experiencing a life 

stressor  (back  pain)  may  be  influenced  by  SOC,  indicating  its  potential  value  for 

occupational social work and industrial psychology. 

The  Ability  to  Nurture.    A  small  study  (N=72)  of  homeless  mothers  with  children 

sought  to  examine  the  relationship  between  SOC  and  the  ability  of  mothers  to  nurture 

their  children  under  the  extreme  stress  of  homelessness  (Flick  &  Homan,  1998).  

Correlations  of  SOC  with  the  Family  Environment  Scale  and  mother-child  interaction 

were significant at p<.10 (ibid., p. 116).  SOC correlated significantly (p<.001) with self-

esteem  and  depression  (ibid.,  p.  117).    Mothers’  SOC  correlated  significantly  and 

negatively  with  child  behavioural  problems  (p<.10,  p<.05  and  p<.01  for  the  three 

subscales) (ibid., p. 120).  The researchers conclude that SOC is “an important construct 

in  explaining  family  environment,  mother-child  interaction,  and  child  problems  in  an 

extremely distressed population” and that as such it is likely to predict better treatment 

outcome (ibid., p. 123). 

Salutogenic  Effects  of  an  MBA  Programme.    A  study  investigated  that  salutogenic 

effect of participating in a US based MBA programme (Ryland, Tegarden, & King, 1998).  

The sample (N=338) comprised 57% American and 43% foreign students.  When age is 

controlled  for,  the  more  experience  students  have  had  in  the  MBA  programme,  the 

higher their SOC scores are, suggesting that the MBA experience enhances SOC (ibid., p. 

133).    However,  more  detailed  analysis  indicates  that  only  male  American  students 

experience  an  increase  in  SOC  over  the  course  of  the  MBA  programme  (ibid.,  p.  134).  

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 33 

Male  foreign  students,  who  started  out  with  similar  scores  to  male  American  students, 

experienced  a  decrease  in  SOC  scores  as  a  result  of  the  MBA  (ibid.,  p.  137).    Female 

American  students  had  higher  SOC  scores  than  female  foreign  students,  but  neither 

group experienced any change in SOC as a result of the MBA programme (ibid.). 

Retirement.  A study of 805 married, retired Israeli men and women investigated the 

role of SOC in adjustment to ‘on-time’ retirement (Sagy & Antonovsky, 1998).  Various 

methods of determining the family’s SOC were tested and will be discussed in the section 

on family SOC.  Results were however consistent in demonstrating that a strong family 

SOC  predicted  adaptation  to  retirement.    When  one  family  member  has  a  higher  SOC 

than  the  rest  of  the  family,  that  member  seems  able  to  mobilise  the  family’s  coping 

resources. 

Caring for the Aged.  A study of 126 people caring for chronically ill elderly people (71 

caring for nondemented chronically ill people and 55 caring for chronically ill people who 

were demented) investigated the role of SOC in enabling the caregivers to cope with the 

demands of giving care (Wagenfeld, Baro, Gallagher, & Haepers, 1998).  The SOC of the 

two  groups  of  caregivers  was  the  same,  despite  the  demented  patients  having  greater 

levels of disability than the nondemented patients (ibid., p. 256).  SOC was found to be 

“protective against role overload” for all caregivers, but most especially for caregivers of 

demented patients (ibid., p. 259).  The researchers propose a “threshold effect” in which 

“the  SOC  seems  to  be  more  protective  in  situations  of  greater  morbidity”  (ibid.).  

Caregivers with stronger SOC tend to utilize healthier coping responses: “redefining the 

meaning  of  the  situation,  selecting  realistic  coping  strategies  and  avoiding  potentially 

maladaptive  or  unhealthy  behaviors”  (ibid).    The  researchers  conclude  that  SOC  is  an 

important  factor  in  enabling  caregivers  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  caregiving, 

particularly when caring for high-stress patients. 

 

2.4.4 

A CRITIQUE OF SENSE OF COHERENCE 

I have been unable to locate any published critiques of the Sense of Coherence.  This is 

surprising  given  the  widespread  use  of  the  construct  in  various  disciplines.    Perhaps  a 

primary  criticism  from  social  work  may  be  the  abstract  nature  of  SOC  that  makes  it 

largely  inaccessible  to  clinical  intervention.    As  a  fundamental  paradigm  or  outlook  on 

life,  SOC  is  deeply  engrained  in  the  psyche  or  personality  of  people.    It  cannot  be 

affected  directly,  but  only  indirectly  through  generating  certain  life  experiences,  which 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 34 

themselves  can  only  be  utilized  in  the  presence  of  resistance  resources.    In  effect,  all 

clinical work needs to promote the development of resistance resources, and hope that 

SOC will follow suit. 

The clinical utility of SOC (and the GRRs) is largely absent from the literature on SOC.  

Researchers  seem  content  to  demonstrate  the  role  of  SOC  in  one  or  other  form  of 

resilience,  but  have  not  made  significant  progress  in  addressing  the  practice  utility  of 

SOC.  Since there are no practice guidelines detailing how to develop SOC, there are also 

no evaluation studies addressing the impact of certain interventions on the evolvement 

of SOC.  The study on cancer outcome reported above (Post-White, 1998), for example, 

addresses  the  change  (or  lack  of  change)  in  SOC  scores  over  the  course  of  an 

intervention, but the intervention was not specifically designed to change SOC and thus 

contributes little to the clinical field. 

It  appears,  therefore,  that  SOC  is  of  theoretical  and  research  interest,  but  has  few 

clinical or preventive applications at present. 

 

2.5  THRIVING 

In  1998,  the  Journal  of  Social  Issues  (Ickovics  &  Park,  1998b)  brought  out  a  special 

issue entitled “Thriving: Broadening the paradigm beyond illness to health” in which they 

made a number of arguments which resemble those of salutogenesis and resilience.  The 

notion  of  thriving  goes  somewhat  further  than  these  constructs,  however,  by  arguing 

that  the  stressor  may  in  fact  enhance  the  functioning  of  the  person.    Thriving  is  here 

defined as (Ickovics & Park, 1998a): 

The  effective  mobilization  of  individual  and  social  resources  in  response  to  risk  or 
threat,  leading  to  positive  mental  or  physical  outcomes  and/or  positive  social 
outcomes.    We  suggest  that  thriving  represents  something  more  than  a  return  to 
equilibrium  (ie  homeostasis)  following  a  challenge  …    We  propose  a  “value-added” 
model,  whereby  an  individual  or  community  may  go  beyond  survival  and  recovery 
from an illness or a stressor to thrive.  (pp. 237-238) 

The notion of thriving prompts the following kinds of questions (Ickovics & Park, 1998a, 

p. 238): 

(cid:153) “What  characteristics  distinguish  the  individuals  who  thrive  following  a  trauma  or 

stressor from those who do not? 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 35 

(cid:153) “How do communities heal and thrive following severe social challenges that result in 

extreme divisions among citizens of different racial and ethnic groups? 

(cid:153) “Can resources be distributed to or developed in individuals across the developmental 

life cycle and across social and cultural contexts to promote the ability to thrive? 

(cid:153) “How  can  knowledge  about  the  factors  that  promote  thriving  be  used  to  promote 

public health and inform public policy? 

(cid:153) “How does thriving relate (or not) to other concepts in psychology and sociology, and 

can it provide an inclusive framework for guiding further study?” 

The  distinction  between  resilience  and  thriving  is  well  illustrated  in  Figure  2.2  (Carver, 

1998,  p.  246),  which  posits  four  possible  responses  to  an  adverse  event,  all  of  which 

assume an initial deterioration of functioning (a ‘downturn’): 

(cid:153) Firstly, the individual’s functioning may continue to deteriorate below the initial level 

of deterioration brought about in the midst of the crisis of the adverse event.  Here 

the individual succumbs to the event. 

(cid:153) Secondly, the individual’s functioning may improve somewhat after the initial crisis, 

but  not  to  the  level  it  was  before  the  adverse  event  –  “the  person  survives  but  is 

diminished or impaired in some respect” (Carver, 1998, p. 246). 

(cid:153) Thirdly,  the  person  bounces  back  to  the  level  of  functioning  enjoyed  before  the 

adverse event, which can be called resilience or recovery. 

(cid:153) Fourthly, “the person may not merely return to the previous level of functioning, but 

may surpass it in some manner” (Carver, 1998, p. 246), something the author calls 

thriving. 

Resilience was previously defined as the ability of people to bounce back after exposure 

to  some  or  other  crisis,  a  “homeostatic  return  to  a  prior  condition”  (Carver,  1998,  p. 

247).    Resilience  literature  does  not  refer  to  the  concept  of  thriving  conceptualised  as 

“better-off-afterward” (ibid.).  Thriving by contrast refers to the acquisition of new skills 

and  knowledge  (learning  about  themselves,  learning  new  coping  skills,  etc),  of  new 

confidence or a sense of mastery, and enhanced interpersonal relationships (ibid.). 

Carver  continues  to  unpack  the  notion  of  resilience  and  thriving  by  exploring  three 

processes by which people recover from or thrive from adversity, as illustrated in Figures 

2.3 to 2.5 (adapted from Carver, 1998, p. 249).

In  the  first  process  (Figure  2.3),  the  individual  becomes  desensitised  to  the  adverse 

event through the exposure to it.  The downturn experienced at Time II is less than at 

Time I, because the individual has been ‘inoculated’ against that stress to some degree.  

The ‘inoculation’ does not enhance the individual’s functioning, but reduces the severity 

of the downturn next time the adversity is encountered.  Eventually it is possible that the 

individual  is  so  desensitised  that  the  adversity  has  no  noticeable  impact  at  all.    The 

overall level of functioning has still not improved above baseline, however, making this 

an example of resilience and not thriving. 

In the second process (Figure 2.4), the downturn experienced at each exposure to the 

adverse event is equally disruptive, but the recovery or  ‘bounce-back’ time  is reduced.  

The person learns to recover more efficiently from the adversity – “they’re hit as hard, 

but they bounce back faster” (Carver, 1998, p. 249).  As with the previous process, the 

baseline functioning does not improve making this also an example of resilience and not 

of thriving. 

In the third process (Figure 2.5), which is extrapolated from Figure 2.2, the individual’s 

functioning  after  the  exposure  to  the  adverse  event  at  Time  I  is  raised  above  initial 

baseline.  When the adverse even is experienced again at Time II, even if the downturn 

is  equally  disruptive,  the  baseline  has  already  been  raised  and  the  event  can  be  used 

again to enhance the individual’s functioning even more.  In this process the functioning 

or  well-being  of  the  individual  is  enhanced  by  the  adversity,  meeting  the  criteria  for 

thriving. 

Thriving thus conceptualised is a transformation, involving a “fundamental cognitive shift 

in response to a challenge” (O'Leary, 1998, p. 430).  Transformation requires an event 

of great adversity (ibid.): 

For such a transformation to occur, the challenge must be profound, an event such 
as facing a fatal illness, a severe traumatic accident or victimization, a great loss, or 
an  existential  crisis  –  events  that  shake  the  foundation  of  one’s  life,  calling  into 
questions  one’s  sense  of  purpose,  meaning  or  identity.    These  events  are  at  the 
extreme because they are the ones that provide the greatest opportunity for a heroic 
response. (p. 430) 

Thriving  and  transformation  require  not  only  a  profound  challenge  or  adverse  event; 

they  also  require  an  individual  with  certain  qualities  who  will  be  able  to  utilize  the 

challenge for thriving.  The question then becomes, what are the qualities of people who, 

when  faced  with  adversity  which  should  result  in  nothing  more  than  recovery,  thrive?  

The answer to this question is similar to the question of what makes children resilient (as 

discussed previously), viz individual resources such as hardiness, coping and a sense of 
Page 39

coherence;  cognitive  resources  such  as  accurate  threat  appraisal,  self-efficacy  and 

perceived personal risk; the ability to attribute and mould the meaning attached to life 

events; social support systems; and social processes or rituals which facilitate transitions 

in life (O'Leary, 1998). 

 

2.6  HARDINESS 

2.6.1 

THE HARDY PERSONALITY 

A  great  deal  of  research  conducted  during  the  1960s  and  1970s  demonstrated  that 

“stressful  life  events  precipitate  somatic  and  psychological  disease”  (Kobasa,  1979,  p. 

1).    Important  research  in  this  regard  was  done  by  Rahe,  who  found  that  “Navy 

personnel who begin a cruise with high stress scores suffer more illness episodes during 

the  months  at  sea  than  do  sailors  who  start  out  with  low  stress  scores”  (ibid.).    The 

Schedule  of  Recent  Life  Events,  which  measures  the  build  up  of  recent  stressful  life 

events,  was  published  by  Holmes  and  Rahe  in  1967  and  is  one  of  the  most  frequently 

cited scales used to measure stress in the papers surveyed in this document. 

Much  of  the  research  that  emerged  as  a  result  of  the  Schedule  of  Recent  Life  Events 

(and  other  similar  scales)  demonstrated  a  consistently  significant  but  moderate 

relationship  between  stress  and  illness.    “Although  correlations  range  from  .20  to  .78, 

the  majority  fall  below  .30,  and  in  Rahe’s  naval  data,  the  correlations  are  consistently 

around  .12”  (Kobasa,  1979,  p.  2).    This  research  demonstrated  the  link  between 

psychosocial phenomena and physical well-being (Kobasa, 1982): 

By  demonstrating  that  the  occurrence  of  life  events  that  cause  change  and 
readjustment (eg job transfer, death of parent, marriage) increases the likelihood of 
one’s falling sick, Holmes, Rahe, and their colleagues forced our conceptualization of 
disease  beyond  physiological  and  biochemical  processes  to  psychological  and 
sociological processes.  (p. 3) 

In  light  of  these  findings,  some  researchers  began  questioning  the  variability  of  stress 

and  illness  scores,  and  the  relatively  moderate  correlation  between  them.    “One  likely 

explanation  for  these  data  is  the  presence  of  subjects  with  high  stress  scores  who  are 

not  getting  sick”  (Kobasa,  1979,  p.  2).    As  was  noted  during  the  discussion  on 

salutogenesis,  researchers  who  had  adopted  the  pathogenic  paradigm  neglected  to 

investigate  the  reasons  for  these  findings.    Those  who  were  more  salutogenically 

oriented did, however, question such findings.  Kobasa was one such researcher. 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 40 

In  order  to  investigate  this,  Kobasa  surveyed  670  middle  and  upper  executives,  and 

found a correlation of .24 (p<.025) between total stress and total illness scores (Kobasa, 

1979,  p.  6).    Using  test  scores  and  random  sampling,  Kobasa  sampled  two  groups  of 

respondents:  86  high  stress/high  illness  respondents  and  75  high  stress/low  illness 

respondents.  Kobasa’s (1979) analysis of the data revealed the following: 

Discriminant function analysis, run on half of the subjects in each group and cross-
validated  on  the  remaining  cases,  supported  the  prediction  that  high  stress/low 
illness executives show, by comparison with high stress/high illness executives, more 
hardiness, that is, have a stronger commitment to self, an attitude of vigorousness 
toward the environment, a sense of meaningfulness, and an internal locus of control.  
(p. 1) 

Kobasa’s  construct  of  hardiness  is  posited  as  mediating  stress  and  illness,  potentially 

reducing the negative effects of stress.  Hardiness itself comprises three subconstructs, 

viz commitment, control and challenge: 

(cid:153) Commitment as opposed to alienation (Kobasa, Maddi, & Courington, 1981, p. 369).  

“Among persons under stress, those who feel committed to the various areas of their 

lives  will  remain  healthier  than  those  who  are  alienated”  (Kobasa,  1979,  p.  4).  

Commitment  is  firstly  the  valuing  of  one’s  life,  one’s  self,  one’s  relationships,  and 

secondly the investment of oneself in these valued dimensions of life (Kobasa, 1982).  

Commitment results in  a sense of purpose that can carry a person through difficult 

turbulent  times.    Commitment  “is  based  in  a  sense  of  community  –  what 

existentialists call being-with-others” (ibid., p. 7). 

(cid:153) Control  as  opposed  to  powerlessness  (Kobasa  et  al.,  1981,  p.  369).    “Among 

persons under stress, those who have a greater sense of control over what occurs in 

their lives will remain healthier than those who feel powerless in the face of external 

forces” (Kobasa, 1979, p. 3).  Control involves acting ‘as if’ one has control over what 

is  happening  around  one.    It  entails  the  belief  (and  consequent  actions)  that  life 

events are in part a result of one’s own actions and attitudes, and thus amenable to 

change.    People  with  control  “can  interpret  and  incorporate  various  sorts  of  events 

into an ongoing life plan and transform these events into something consistent and 

not so jarring to the organism” (Kobasa, 1982, p. 7). 

(cid:153) Challenge  as  opposed  to  threat  (Kobasa  et  al.,  1981,  p.  369).    “Among  persons 

under stress, those who view change as a challenge will remain healthier than those 

who view it as a threat” (Kobasa, 1979, p. 5).  “Challenge is based on the belief that 

change,  rather  than  stability,  is  the  normative  mode  of  life”  (Kobasa,  1982,  p.  7).  

With this outlook on life, stressful life events are viewed neither with surprise (since 
Page 41 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

they are anticipated) nor with dismay (since they are seen as exciting opportunities 

for growth and development). 

Kobasa describes the hardy person as follows (Kobasa et al., 1981): 

Hardy  persons  have  considerable  curiosity  and  tend  to  find  their  experiences 
interesting  and  meaningful.    Further,  they  believe  they  can  be  influential  through 
what  they  imagine,  say,  and  do.    At  the  same  time,  they  expect  change  to  be  the 
norm, and regard it as an important stimulus to development.  These various beliefs 
and tendencies are very useful in coping with stressful events.  Optimistic cognitive 
appraisals  are  made;  changes  are  perceived  as  natural  enough,  meaningful,  and 
even interesting despite their stressfulness, and in that sense are kept in perspective.  
Also, decisive actions are taken to find out more about the changes, to incorporate 
them into an ongoing life plan, and to learn from their occurrence whatever may be 
of value for the future.  In these ways, hardy persons transform stressful events into 
less stressful forms.  (pp. 368-369) 

People  who  are  low  in  hardiness  are,  by  contrast,  described  as  follows  (Kobasa  et  al., 

1981): 

Persons  low  in  hardiness  tend  to  find  themselves  and  the  environment  boring, 
meaningless,  and  threatening.    They  feel  powerless  in  the  face  of  overwhelming 
forces, believing that life is best when it involves no changes.  As such, they have no 
real  conviction  that  development  is  either  possible  or  important,  and  are  passive  in 
their interactions with the environment.  When stressful events occur, such persons 
have little basis for optimistic cognitive appraisal or decisive actions.  Because their 
personalities  provide  little  or  no  buffer,  the  stressful  events  are  allowed  to  have  a 
debilitating effect on health. (p. 369) 

Kobasa  and  most  other  researchers  in  the  field  measure  hardiness  with  a  set  of  five 

scales (Kobasa, 1982): 

Those  scales  that  had  proven  [in  the  1979  study]  to  be  the  most  effective  in 
discriminating  between  high  stress/low  illness  and  high  stress/high  illness  subjects 
and that were, in interaction with stressful life events scores, the best predictors of 
illness across the whole executive group were included in the composite.  Alienation 
from  Self  and  Alienation  from  Work  from  the  Alienation  Test  (Maddi  et  al.,  1979) 
were selected as negative indicators of commitment.  The dimension of control was 
also measured negatively through the Internal External Locus of Control scale (Rotter 
et al., 1962) and the Powerlessness scale of the Alienation Test (Maddi et al., 1979).  
Finally, challenge was measured negatively by the Security scale of the California Life 
Goals  Evaluation  Schedule  (Hahn,  1966).    The  intercorrelations  among  the  five 
chosen scales were found to be significant in the expected direction.  In a principal 
components  factor  analysis,  a  first  factor  (accounting  for  46.5%  of  the  variance) 
emerges that is interpretable as hardiness.  To provide a single personality hardiness 
score  for  each  executive,  z  scores  were  computed  for  the  five  measures.    As  the 
challenge  dimension  was  indexed  by  only  one  scale  (Security),  its  scores  were 
doubled.  This weighted security score was added to the other four scores.  (p. 14) 

It is this composite hardiness score that is used in most of the studies cited and is the 

scale typically referred to as the Hardiness Scale.

2.6.2 

HARDINESS AND HEALTH 

One  study  (Kobasa  et  al.,  1981,  p.  376)  found  that  “stressful  life  events  and 

constitutional  predisposition  [measured  by  evaluating  the  respondents’  parents’  illness 

history]  increase  illness,  whereas  personality-based  hardiness  decreases  illness”.    The 

researchers  conclude  that  hardiness  is  a  resistance  resource,  protecting  vulnerable 

people from illness. 

A study of 137 white male managers investigated the relationships between hardiness, 

exercise, stress and illness (Kobasa, Maddi, & Puccetti, 1982b).  Hardiness and exercise 

were  found  to  be  unrelated,  as  expected,  and  each  was  found  independently  to 

contribute to health.  The researchers conclude (ibid.): 

Subjects high in both hardiness and exercise remain more healthy than those high in 
one  or  the  other  only.    These  additive  effects  are  consistent  with  the  view  that 
hardiness  buffers  by  transforming  the  events  themselves  so  as  to  decrease  their 
stressfulness, whereas exercise buffers by decreasing the organismic strain resulting 
from experiencing stressful events. (p. 391) 

Since the stress-hardiness-illness interaction has often been studied retrospectively, it is 

possible that the state of health under stressful conditions creates hardiness, rather than 

the  other  way  round  (Kobasa,  1982).    As  a  result,  a  number  of  studies  have  been 

conducted prospectively to investigate the direction of causation (eg. Kobasa, Maddi, & 

Kahn, 1982a).  This study examined the stress, illness and hardiness of a group of 259 

white  male  middle  and  upper  level  managers  over  a  two-year  period  (plus  three  years 

retrospective  data).    By  controlling  for  illness  at  Time  I,  the  researchers  were  able  to 

investigate  the  effect  of  hardiness  and  stress  at  Time  I  on  the  development  of  illness 

between Times I and III.  The researchers concluded (Kobasa, 1982): 

Even  when  prior  illness  is  controlled  for,  stressful  life  events  are  linked  with  an 
increase and hardiness with a decrease in illness reports.  The significant stress and 
hardiness interaction demonstrates that it is especially crucial for one’s health to be 
hardy when one is undergoing an intensely stressful time.  (p. 15) 

Another  prospective  study  involved  217  white  male  middle  and  upper  level  managers 

who were assessed on two occasions, separated by two years (Howard, Cunningham, & 

Rechnitzer, 1986).  These researchers used the dependence/independence dimension of 

Cattell’s  Sixteen  Personality  Factor  Questionnaire  as  a  measure  of  hardiness.    The 

“results  indicate  that  for  individuals  classified  as  Type  A1,  changes  in  job  stress  (role 

ambiguity) were significantly related to changes in blood pressure and triglyceride levels 

and that this effect appears to be significantly moderated by the personality dimension 

dependence/independence” (ibid., p. 241). 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 43 

A  similar  study  was  conducted  with  140  white  male  middle  and  upper  level  managers 

(Kobasa, Maddi, & Zola, 1983).  The measures of hardiness and Type A were found to 

not  correlate,  indicating  their  independence.    Data  analysis  demonstrated  that  while 

stressful life events lead to illness and hardiness protects health, Type A had no direct 

influence on health status (ibid., p. 47).  The authors concluded (ibid.): 

Persons  who  are  not  only  high  in  Type  A  behavior,  but  simultaneously  low  in 
hardiness, show the greatest deterioration of general health in the face of mounting 
stressful  life  events.    If  health  is  to  be  preserved  in  the  encounter  with  stressful 
events,  it  would  appear  important  that  one’s  driven  concern  for  reaching  extrinsic 
goals  (high  Type  A  behavior)  be  mitigated  by  an  ability  to  experience  the  intrinsic 
interest  and  value  of  the  activities  and  tasks  encountered  along  the  way  (high 
hardiness).  (p. 49) 

 

2.6.3 

CRITIQUES OF HARDINESS 

Despite  the  apparent  unequivocality  of  the  above  studies,  several  studies  have  found 

conflicting  or  inconsistent  results.    Others  have  levied  various  criticisms  against  the 

construct hardiness and its measurement. 

A study by Schmied and Lawler (1986) of 82 female, mostly white, university secretaries 

found no mediating effects from Type A and hardiness on the stress-illness relationship. 

Type A and hardiness did correlate in the expected directions with stress, and stress did 

correlate  in  the  expected  direction  with  illness,  but  neither  Type  A  nor  hardiness 

correlated with illness (ibid., p. 1221). 

Another  study  (Ganellen  &  Blaney,  1984)  of  83  female  undergraduate  students  found 

that hardiness and social support were so closely interrelated as to be not independent 

and that hardiness contributed little buffering effect to life stress.  

Although an exhaustive review of research into hardiness has not been conducted, it is 

interesting to note that all of the studies cited here which find support for the hardiness 

theories were conducted with white, male, protestant, middle and upper level managers 

in the USA.  In contrast, the two studies that failed to support the hardiness theory were 

conducted  with  female  non-managers.    Perhaps  the  hardiness  construct  is  culturally 

loaded in favour of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant males. 

In  a  critique  of  the  hardiness  concept  and  in  particular  the  measurement  of  hardiness, 

Hull, Van Treuren and Virnelli (1987) highlight the inconsistent measurement procedures 

used, despite the description of the Hardiness Scale provided above.  For instance, in a 
Page 44 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

1982 study Kobasa “measured commitment with the scales of Powerlessness (previously 

identified  [in  the  1979  study]  as  a  measure  of  control)  and  Vegetativeness  (previously 

identified [in 1979] as a measure of challenge)” (ibid., p. 521).  As a second instance, 

the  use  of  z  scores  significantly  complicates  secondary  data  analysis,  since  each  study 

generates a mean hardiness score of zero (ibid.).  The reviewers then state: 

We draw the following conclusions: (a) Hardiness is not a unitary phenomenon, but 
should  be  treated  as  involving  three  separate  phenomena;  (b)  of  the  three 
subcomponents  of  hardiness,  only  commitment  and  control  have  adequate 
psychometric properties and are systematically related to health outcomes; (c) lack 
of  control  and  lack  of  commitment  have  direct  effects  on  health  because  they  are 
psychologically  stressful;  and  (d)  if  there  are  buffering  effects  of  commitment  and 
control,  they  are  in  addition  to  these  direct  effects  and  are  situation  specific.    (p. 
518) 

A final critique (Strümpfer, 1990) highlights the pathogenic approach to measuring what 

is  intended  to  be  a  salutogenic  construct.    The  concept  of  hardiness  was  intended  to 

explain  why  certain  people  who  are  exposed  to  high  stress  do  not  become  ill  as 

expected, in line with  the salutogenic paradigm.  The cluster of scales used by Kobasa 

and  others  to  measure  the  three  hardiness  constructs  are  all  negative  indicators,  viz 

alienation from self and from work for commitment, need for security for challenge, and 

powerlessness and external locus of control for control.  Strümpfer (1990) concludes: 

To  express  high  levels  of  a  characteristic  in  terms  of  low  scores  on  another  seems 
dubious  on  both  theoretical  and  psychometric  grounds.    Funk  and  Houston  (1987) 
pointed  out  that  a  low  score  on,  for  instance,  alienation  may  represent  neutral 
feelings, and not the presence of feelings opposite to alienation. … The view that the 
Hardiness  Scale  measures  pathogenic  variables  could  be  supported  by  Funk  and 
Houston’s suggestion that, on the basis of item contents, the Hardiness Scale may be 
“better  construed  as  tapping  something  similar  to  general  maladjustment  or 
psychopathology” (1987, p. 573).  Indeed, these authors found that when emotional 
maladjustment was controlled statistically, significant correlations between hardiness 
and  health  reports  dropped  below  significance;  Rhodewalt  and  Zone  (1989) 
confirmed  this  finding.    In  view  of  these  conceptual,  measurement  and  validity 
problems, I am inclined to consider the hardiness construct as part of the salutogenic 
paradigm  but  both  its  operationalization  and  the  supporting  evidence  is  still  very 
much in the pathogenic framework.  (pp. 271-272) 

 

2.7  LEARNED RESOURCEFULNESS 

‘Learned  resourcefulness’  (Rosenbaum  &  Ben-Ari,  1985)  emerged  in  the  field  of 

behaviour  modification  and  presented  a  contrast  to  ‘learned  helplessness’.    Learned 

helplessness  studies  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  that  when  people’s  efforts  to 

change  an  uncontrollable  event  are  futile,  they  tend  to  generalise  this  expectancy  to 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 45 

situations which are, in fact, controllable (ibid.).  Learned helplessness thus accounts for 

people’s  responses  to  controllable  events  after  exposure  to  uncontrollable  events.  

During  such  a  process,  people  learn  to  believe  that  they  are  helpless  to  influence  or 

control external events. 

Self-control  studies,  by  contrast,  focus  on what  happens  when  a  person’s  habitual  and 

effective  behaviour  in  dealing  with  a  controllable  situation,  becomes  ineffective  in  an 

uncontrollable  situation.    “The  self-regulatory  process  is  activated  …  only  when  the 

smooth  flow  of  ongoing  behavior  is  disrupted”  (Rosenbaum  &  Ben-Ari,  1985,  p.  199).  

Self-regulation thus enables a person to continue with goal-directed and self-sustaining 

activities,  even  in  the  absence  of  external  reinforcement  (success).    Training  in  self-

regulation  or 

self-management  assists 

“people 

to 

change 

their  behaviour 

notwithstanding  ongoing  stimulation  that  favours  the  undesirable  habits,  so  that  they 

become less dependent on the environment” (Strümpfer, 1990, p. 273).  It is within the 

context of self-control studies that the construct learned resourcefulness emerged. 

Rosenbaum noted that people differ in their capacity for self-regulation or self-control or 

self-management,  and  introduced  “the  term  learned  resourcefulness  to  describe  an 

acquired  repertoire  of  behaviors  and  skills  (mostly  cognitive)  by  which  a  person  self-

regulates  internal  responses  (such  as  emotions,  cognitions,  or  pain)  that  interfere  with 

the smooth execution of a desired behavior” (Rosenbaum & Ben-Ari, 1985, p. 200). 

Rosenbaum (1988, in Strümpfer, 1990, p. 273) explained the process of self-regulation 

as comprising three phases: 

(cid:153) “Representation,  during  which  the  individual  experiences,  without  any  conscious 

effort,  a  cognitive  and/or  emotional  reaction  to  changes  within  him-/herself  or  the 

environment; 

(cid:153) “Evaluation  of  the  changes,  first,  as  desirable  or  threatening,  then,  if  threat  is 

appraised, evaluation whether anything can be done about it; 

(cid:153) “Action  (or  coping  in  most  other  terminology)  to  minimize  negative  effects  of  the 

internal or external changes.” 

An example may serve to clarify this process.  Assume a social worker has been working 

with couples with communication difficulties for a number of years and has come to learn 

that  certain  clinical  interventions  and  processes  are  habitually  successful.    One  day  a 

couple arrives for counselling, but the usual therapy no longer works.  The social worker 

notes  the  lack  of  success  and  begins  to  feel  frustrated,  angry,  anxious  and  helpless 
Page 46 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

(representation).  The resourceful social worker will, at this point begin to evaluate what 

is going wrong and whether there is anything she can do about it.  She tells herself that 

she  is  a  resourceful,  flexible  and  creative  therapist,  who  is  not  locked  into  only  one 

model  of  intervention.    She  begins  thinking  of  other  approaches  that  may  be  effective 

with  this  couple  (evaluation).    She  shifts  to  adopt  another  model  and  begins 

implementing it (action).  By contrast, the less resourceful social worker succumbs to the 

sense  of  failure,  believes  she  is  useless  and  that  her  repertoire  of  skills  is  insufficient.  

She  then  moves  into  self-protection  and  blames  the  clients,  arguing  that  they  are 

resistant (evaluation).  She confronts them aggressively with their lack of co-operation 

and terminates the counselling (action). 

People who succeed in regulating their internal processes during difficult situations, such 

as the resourceful social worker above, acquire the skill of self-regulation.  Next time a 

difficult situation arises, they are more adept at regulating their internal processes and 

are thus better able to respond effectively to the situation.  In this way, resourcefulness 

is  learned,  hence,  learned  resourcefulness.    Rosenbaum  and  Ben-Ari’s  1985  research 

demonstrated that (Strümpfer, 1990): 

Low  resourceful  persons  judge  themselves  inefficacious  in  coping  with  emotional 
strains  and  difficult  tasks;  as  a  consequence,  they  tend  to  dwell  more  on  their 
deficiencies  than  on  the  task.    High  resourceful  persons,  on  the  other  hand,  judge 
themselves more efficacious in dealing with emotional and task demands and are, as 
a consequence, more likely to continue with self-regulation.  (p. 273) 

Learned resourcefulness is not a personality trait, but rather a cluster of cognitive skills.  

“Learned resourcefulness is a basic behavioral repertoire (Staats, 1975) that is learned 

from  the  moment  of  birth  and  serves  as  a  basis  for  coping  with  stressful  situations” 

(Rosenbaum & Palmon, 1984, p. 245). 

Rosenbaum developed the Self-Control Schedule (SCS), a 36-item instrument using a 6-

point  scale,  to  measure  learned  resourcefulness.    The  scale  (Rosenbaum  &  Palmon, 

1984): 

Covers the following content areas: (a) use of cognitions and self-instructions to cope 
with  emotional  and  physiological  responses,  (b)  application  of  problem-solving 
strategies (eg planning, problem definition, evaluating alternatives, and anticipation 
of consequences); (c) ability to delay immediate gratification, and (d) a general belief 
in one’s ability to self-regulate internal events.  (p. 246) 

The  SCS  demonstrates  good  psychometric  properties,  with  alpha  coefficients  ranging 

from  .78  to  .86  in  various  studies,  and  test-retest  reliability  over  four  weeks  of  .96 

(Rosenbaum & Palmon, 1984, p. 246).

Research  comparing  high  resourceful  people  with  low  resourceful  ones  has  yielded 

consistently  positive  results  (summarised  by  Strümpfer,  1990,  pp.  273-274).    High 

resourceful people, compared with low resourceful people: 

(cid:153) “Tolerated  laboratory-induced  pain  longer  and  used  self-control  methods  more 

frequently and more effectively in doing so (Rosenbaum, 1980b);

aspects of their pain, and used prophylactic medication more (Courey, Feuerstein &

control  methods  as  part  of  coping  with  the  psychological  consequences  of  seizures

thoughts  (Rosenbaum  &  Ben-Ari,  1985).”    (summarised  by  Strümpfer,  1990,  pp. 

273-274) 

Another  study  (Simons,  Lustman,  Wetzel  &  Murphy  (in  press),  cited  in  Rosenbaum  & 

Ben-Ari, 1985, p. 200) found that “SCS scores were the single best predictor of success 

in  cognitive  therapy  of  depression,”  irrespective  of  the  degree  of  depression  at 

presentation.    “Cognitive  therapy  probably  helped  the  highly  resourceful  depressed 

subjects in developing and applying skills already in their repertoire.”  

 

2.8  SELF-EFFICACY 

Like learned resourcefulness, self-efficacy (Bandura, 1982) also emerged within the field 

of behaviour modification.  Bandura argues that many of the constructs covered in this 

section on individual resilience centre on “people’s sense of personal efficacy to produce 

and to regulate events in their lives” (ibid., p. 122).  Perceived self-efficacy thus entails 

“judgements  of  how  well  one  can  execute  courses  of  action  required  to  deal  with 

prospective situations” (ibid.). 

According  to  Bandura  (1982),  people  are  constantly  busy  with  judgements  of  self-

efficacy.  Every action taken is preceded by an unconscious judgement of one’s ability to 

execute the action effectively.  Accurate appraisal of one’s efficacy is important so as to 

avoid  taking  on  tasks  that  are,  in  fact,  outside  of  one’s  ability.    Perceived  self-efficacy 

also influences effort (Bandura, 1982): 

Judgements  of  self-efficacy  also  determine  how  much  effort  people  will  expend  and 
how  long  they  will  persist  in  the  face  of  obstacles  or  aversive  experiences.    When 
beset  with  difficulties  people  who  entertain  serious  doubts  about  their  capabilities 
slacken their efforts or give up altogether, whereas those who have a strong sense of 
efficacy  exert  greater  effort  to  master  the  challenges.  …  High  perseverance  usually 
produces high performance attainments.  (p. 123) 

As  with  learned  resourcefulness,  people  with  a  strong  sense  of  efficacy  focus  their 

attention on handling the task and are energised by difficulties, while people who doubt 

their efficacy tend to be consumed by their inadequacies and have little energy to deal 

with  the  task  at  hand  (Bandura,  1982).    Behavioural  research  involving  the  artificial 

elevation of perceived self-efficacy demonstrates that “people successfully execute tasks 

that fall within their enhanced range of perceived self-efficacy, but shun or fail those that 

exceed their perceived coping capabilities” (ibid., p. 126).  Even when they know what to 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 49 

do,  people  who  lack  self-efficacy  tend  to  perform  ineffectively  in  accordance  with  their 

perceived efficacy (ibid.). 

Bandura argues that judgements of self-efficacy are based on information derived from 

four sources (1982, pp. 126-127): 

(cid:153) Enactive  Attainments.    The  most  influential  source  of  information  is  previous 

success,  since  success  breeds  success.    Likewise,  previous  failure  decreases 

perceived self-efficacy and increases the likelihood of future failure. 

(cid:153) Vicarious  Experiences.    Seeing  other  people,  who  are  judged  to  be  similar  in 

competence to oneself, succeed in tasks, increases one’s own self-efficacy.  Likewise, 

seeing similar others fail in tasks decreases one’s own self-efficacy, through vicarious 

learning. 

(cid:153) Verbal Persuasion.  Attempts by others to verbally persuade a person to believe in 

themselves  have  limited  effect.    Nevertheless,  such  persuasion  may  result  in  the 

person trying harder in the next attempt at a task, increasing the chances of success.  

This  success  then  provides  the  enactive  attainment  that  enhances  self-efficacy, 

increasing the chances of future success. 

(cid:153) Physiological State.  People judge their capability in part on the physiological state 

of arousal.  Excess or aversive arousal informs the individual that failure is imminent 

and  consequently  self-efficacy  decreases  and  the  chances  of  failure  do  in  fact 

increase. 

performance. 

Empirical studies confirm that self-efficacy can be influenced through these four sources 

of  information,  and  that  this  has  a  direct  and  significant  impact  on  performance 

(Bandura, 1982, p. 128).  This is a large part of the value of the construct self-efficacy – 

its  capacity  to  be  influenced  through  intervention  and  the  direct  effect  of  this  on 

Zunz  (1998)  reports  a  study  examining  resilience  factors  which  protect  human  service 

providers  (n=101)  from  burnout.    Respondents  were  largely  female  (69%)  and  social 

workers (62%).  Each of the seven protective factors used in the study (including self-

efficacy)  were  correlated  with  at  least  one  of  the  three  measures  of  burnout  (viz 

emotional  exhaustion,  depersonalisation  and  personal  accomplishment).    Self-efficacy 

was the only resilience factor to emerge in three regression analyses (using the burnout 

measures  as  criterion  variables),  accounting  for  “21%  of  the  variance  in  emotional 

exhaustion,  and  along  with  sense  of  mission,  predicting  32%  of  the  variance  in 
Page 50 
Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

depersonalization  and  39%  in  personal  accomplishment"  (Zunz,  1998,  p.  50).    The 

researcher concludes that human service agencies should clearly define mastery of and 

effectiveness  in  management  tasks,  thereby  increasing  the  development  of  manager’s 

work-related self-efficacy. 

 

2.9  LOCUS OF CONTROL 

Locus of control, a construct that has much in common with self-efficacy, emerged in the 

field of social learning theory (Rotter, 1966).  Rotter argues that behaviour is reinforced 

to  the  degree  that  the  individual  perceives  the  consequences  of  the  behaviour  to  be 

contingent  on  (or  controlled  by)  his/her  own  behaviour  rather  than  under  control  of 

other  external  forces.    These  external  forces  could  include  “luck,  chance,  fate,  … 

powerful  others,  or  …  unpredictable”  (ibid.,  p.  1).    When  a  “person  perceives  that  the 

event  is  contingent  upon  his  own  behavior  or  his  own  relatively  permanent 

characteristics,  we  have  termed  this  a  belief  in  internal  control”  (ibid.).    Conversely, 

when a person perceives an event to be contingent on other forces, this person is said to 

have a belief in external control. 

Research indicates that (Rotter, 1966): 

The individual who has a strong belief that he can control his own destiny is likely to 
(a)  be  more  alert  to  those  aspects  of  the  environment  which  provide  useful 
information  for  his  future  behavior;  (b)  take  steps  to  improve  his  environmental 
condition;  (c)  place  greater  value  on  skill  or  achievement  reinforcements  and  be 
generally  more  concerned  with  his  ability,  particularly  his  failures;  and  (d)  be 
resistive to subtle attempts to influence him.  (p. 25) 

Rotter  developed  the  Internal-External  (I-E)  scale  to  measure  locus  of  control  (Rotter, 

1966).    The  scale  is  negatively  scored,  so  that  a  high  score  indicates  a  high  external 

locus of control.  “The items deal exclusively with the subjects’ belief about the nature of 

the  world.    That  is,  they  are  concerned  with  the  subjects’  expectations  about  how 

reinforcement is controlled.  Consequently, the test is considered to be a measure of a 

generalized  expectancy”  (ibid.,  p.  10).    Rotter  reports  internal  consistency  scores  from 

.52 to .79 and test-retest reliability scores (over 1-2 months) from .49 to .83 (ibid., p. 

13). 

Kobasa,  who  used  the  I-E  scale  as  a  measure  of  her  ‘control’  construct  (1981),  found 

that high stress/high illness executives had a greater external locus of control than high 

stress/low illness executives (t = 2.03, p<.05) (1979, p. 7).  Another study by Johnson 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 51 

and Sarason (1978, cited in Kobasa, 1982, p. 13) found that college “students believing 

in  an  internal  locus  of  control  showed  a  lower  correlation  between  stressful  life  events 

and illness than did subjects who reported an external orientation”. 

A  study  of  50  epileptic  patients  found  a  link  between  locus  of  control  and  learned 

resourcefulness (Rosenbaum & Palmon, 1984).  Results indicate that highly resourceful 

patients had a greater internal locus of control and a greater degree of perceived control 

over  their  seizures  than  low  resourceful  patients,  regardless  of  the  severity  of  the 

seizures (ibid., p. 250). 

The distinction between Rotter’s Locus of Control and Antonovsky’s Sense of Coherence 

was  detailed  previously.    Antonovsky  criticises  Rotter’s  Locus  of  Control  construct  as 

being  culturally  biased  in  favour  of  Western,  Protestant  ethics,  and  asks  “What  would 

someone  with  a  belief  that  God  has  already  determined  his  destiny  score  on  Rotter’s 

scale?” (Antonovsky, 1979, p. 155).  Notwithstanding Antonovsky’s concern, the locus of 

control concept has enjoyed great popularity, and has resulted in the generation of many 

scales (Fischer & Corcoran, 1994b, printed 17 scales measuring various aspects of locus 

of control) and much research on the subject. 

2.10  OTHER RESILIENCE FACTORS 

In  addition  to  these  major  contributions  to  the  field  of  resilience  theory,  a  number  of 

other  writers  have  generated  resilience  factors  that  are  of  value,  viz  potency,  stamina 

 

 

and personal causation. 

2.10.1  POTENCY 

The  construct  ‘potency’  was  developed  by  an  Israeli  social  worker,  Ben-Sira,  and  is 

defined as “a person’s enduring confidence in his own capacities as well as confidence in 

and  commitment  to  his/her  social  environment,  which  is  perceived  as  being 

characterized by a basically meaningful and predictable order and by a reliable and just 

distribution  of  rewards”  (Ben-Sira,  1985,  in  Strümpfer,  1990,  p.  272).    Strümpfer 

continues: 

Ben-Sira  viewed  potency  as  a  mechanism  that  prevents  the  tension  which  follows 
occasional inadequate coping, from turning into a lasting stress.  It is the outcome of 
Page 52 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

successful  past  experiences  of  coping  and  hence  comprises  mastery  and  self-
appreciation; weak potency, on the other hand, results from a history of unsuccessful 
coping  experiences.    These  same  alternatives  of  experience  contribute  to  either  a 
view  of  society  as  meaningful  and  ordered,  or  an  orientation  of  anomie,  which  in 
turn,  are  related  to  either  commitment  to  society  or  alienation.    Similarities  to 
Antonovsky’s SOC seem quite clear; in fact, Ben-Sira and Antonovsky have had close 
academic and personal associations.  (p. 272) 

2.10.2  STAMINA 

Strümpfer  (1990) reports two researchers who have used the term ‘stamina’ to refer to 

the concept of resilience.  Thomas (1981, in Strümpfer, 1990, p. 272), who conducted 

longitudinal  research  on  medical  students,  defined  stamina  as  “The  physical  and  moral 

strength to resist or withstand disease, fatigue, or hardship; endurance.”  She compared 

psychological,  social  and  family  factors  that  influenced  the  life  course  of  adults,  and 

concluded, “Human beings are born with different potentialities and susceptibilities which 

life  experiences  may  then  mold  into  a  protective  shield  undergirding  future  health” 

(ibid.). 

Colerick also used the term stamina in her study of patterns of aging.  She asked, “What 

qualities  distinguish  older  persons  who  demonstrate  emotional  resilience  despite  age-

related  losses  and  life  change?”  (Colerick,  1985,  in  Strümpfer,  1990,  p.  272).    She 

referred  to  stamina  as  a  “capacity  for  growth,  personal  insight,  life  perspective, 

likelihood of functional breakdown and general competence” (ibid.). 

 

 

2.10.3  PERSONAL CAUSATION 

De  Charms  (1968,  p.  269)  states,  “Man’s  primary  motivational  propensity  is  to  be 

effective in producing changes in his environment.  Man strives to be a causal agent, to 

be  the  primary  locus  of  causation  for,  or  the  origin  of,  his  behavior;  he  strives  for 

personal  causation.”    Personal  causation  is  thus  concerned  with  “being  the  master  of 

one’s fate” or “being an agent of change in the environment” (ibid., pp. 270-271). 

De Charms argues that achieving one’s goals and the satisfaction that results from that 

is  not  sufficient  to  explain  human  behaviour.    The  process  of  achieving  one’s  goals  is 

paramount.  “Attaining a goal through luck, chance, or through the benevolent agency of 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 53 

a helper is not the same as doing it myself” (De Charms, 1968, p. 271).  The essence of 

personal causation is stated as follows (ibid.): 

A man is not a stone, for he is a direct source of energy; nor is he a machine, for the 
direction  of  the  behavior  resulting  from  his  energy  comes  entirely  from  within  him.  
Rather, man is the origin of his behavior. (p. 271) 

De  Charms  extrapolates  from  the  idea  that  people  are  the  origin  of  their  behaviour  to 

state that people are constantly struggling against being constrained by external forces, 

that  is,  against  being  moved  as  a  pawn.    This  distinction  between  ‘Origin’  and  ‘Pawn’ 

parallels the distinction between ‘free’ and ‘forced’.  “An Origin is a person who perceives 

his behavior as determined by his own choosing; a Pawn is a person who perceives his 

behavior  as  determined  by  external  forces  beyond  his  control”  (De  Charms,  1968,  pp. 

273-274).  An individual’s sense of him or herself as Pawn or Origin directly influences 

that  individual’s  behaviour,  regardless  of  any  objective  external  evidence.    The  most 

fundamental  motivational  force  is  an  individual’s  own  sense  of  whether  s/he  is  more 

Pawn or more Origin (ibid., p. 319). 

Although  De  Charms  recognises  the  close  similarity  between  Rotter’s  Internal  Locus  of 

Control  and  his  own  Personal  Causation,  he  argues  that  locus  of  control  is  a  more 

restricted  construct  than  personal  causation  (De  Charms,  1968,  p.  321).    Locus  of 

control,  being  located  within  social  learning  theory,  focuses  its  attention  on  the 

consequences  of  behaviour,  rather  than  on  the  behaviour  itself,  thereby  restricting  its 

De  Charms  addresses  the  notion  of  personal  causation  at  a  philosophical,  existential 

level, and does not pull it through to empirical, practical or clinical utility.  Nor does he 

address how a sense of personal causation comes to develop. As such, its practice value

is limited. 

 

2.11 

CONCLUSION 

Two  principle  aspects  of  individual  resilience  are  described  in  the  literature  and  have 

been reflected in this chapter: 

(cid:153) Firstly, the dominant pathogenic paradigm has been challenged.  Some researchers, 

theorists and clinicians are questioning the value and reality base of a worldview that 

emphasises  the  development  of  pathology  as  its  central  concern.    They  propose  an 

Resilience Theory: A Literature Review  
 

Page 54 

alternative  paradigm,  which  is  most  frequently  termed  salutogenesis,  which 

addresses the origin of health. 

(cid:153) At  the  centre  of  this  paradigm  is  a  generic  question,  viz  “How  is  it,  when  several 

people are exposed to the same stressor, that some of them break down while others 

remain healthy or even thrive?” 

(cid:153) The  inevitable  next  question  leads  to  the  second  aspect  of  individual  resilience 

described  in  this  chapter,  viz  the  factors  that  make  certain  individuals  resilient.  

Numerous factors have been explored in this chapter, including sense of coherence, 

hardiness,  learned  resourcefulness,  self-efficacy,  locus  of  control,  potency,  stamina 

and  personal  causation.    In  addition,  various  factors  that  protect  children  from  the 

adverse effects of childhood risk were also outlined. 

Unfortunately, the literature on individual resilience has two main shortcomings: 

(cid:153) Firstly,  this  literature,  which  dominates  (or  has  dominated)  the  field  of  resilience 

theory,  addresses  only  or  predominantly  intrapsychic  factors  in  resilience.    Many  of 

the key constructs, such as Sense of Coherence, are defined as part of the structure 

of  personality.    Little  attention  is  paid  to  factors  within  the  environment  or  social 

system that promote the resilience of the individual. 

(cid:153) Second,  this  focus  on  intrapsychic  resilience  leads  to  the  second  shortcoming,  viz 

many of the resilience constructs reviewed in this chapter do not translate easily into 

clinical  practice.    Sense  of  Coherence,  for  instance,  which  is  a  widely  cited  and 

researched  resilience  construct,  has  no  clear  clinical  implication  outside  of 

assessment.    A  client  referred  for  psychotherapy  can  be  assessed  for  Sense  of 

Coherence.    Once  a  low  SOC  score  has  been  attained,  the  clinician  can  do  nothing 

with this result other than conclude that the client may struggle to make positive use 

of a therapeutic relationship. 

(cid:153) Other resilience factors, such as learned resourcefulness and locus of control, seem 

to lead more easily to clinical intervention, but even, this is not clear in the literature 

This  shortcoming  is  particularly  disappointing  given  the  basic  salutogenic  question, 

“What  enables  people  to  overcome  adversity?”    The  answer  to  this  question  should 

surely  provide  people  who  lack  resilience  with  some  hope,  some  kind  of  answer  as  to 

how to become more resilient.  A person lacking resilience will not, however, make much 

use  of  the  advice  to  develop  a  sense  of  coherence  or  to  build  their  sense  of  personal 

causation.

These shortcomings are not to say that the individual resilience constructs do not have 

clinical implications.  Rather, these implications have not been explored and researched.  

Early in this chapter it was noted that researchers have tended to focus on pathogenesis, 

while  clinicians  attended  to  salutogenesis  (Pearlin  &  Schooler,  1982).    It  appears, 

however,  now  that  extensive  research  has  been  done  on  salutogenic  factors,  that 

clinicians need to begin exploring how to develop these factors through clinical and other 

interventions.    In  particular,  preventive  issues  need  to  be  explored  so  that  resilience 

factors can be developed as a matter of course in the general public and not only among 

the small percentage of individuals who have some form of pathology.
